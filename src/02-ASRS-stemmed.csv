We descent runway 29 about two mile ( 900 FT ) ; other aircraft appear 12 o'clock mayb 200 FT abov ; wing level . aircraft wa not seen befor it wa veri close . bottom aircraft wa dirti white cloud gray . aircraft pass overhead befor I could take evas action . I immedi notifi tower that traffic just pass directli over . after land ; ground control ; I advis tower I would call them land line . call tower spoke manag . A later ; I receiv a call aircraft owner ; he said pilot wa still flying.almost hour later ; I receiv a call pilot . We talk about incid . pilot is not thi area did not seem familiar area . hi locat downwind put him over water long island sound so he veri littl ground refer hi 360 turn back down wind . I ask him about wind he state 340 6 . We discuss wind pattern altitud I suggest it might be much stronger more north ( local knowledg ) . He agre wind lack ground refer over water could have allow him drift down wind dure hi 360 turn downwind . lack radar thi airport wa a direct factor thi nmac ! faa commit instal radar 1994 ha still not been fulfil ! I have been a pilot over 50 year . thi is my fourth nmac thi airport ! three four nmac 's have occur sinc 1994 ; when faa said they would instal radar . all three would have been prevent radar tower ! can somebodi pleas tell me if a mid collis is a requir radar be instal sikorski memori airport ? 
562,3,2000,A flight crew report a near miss approach ack anoth aircraft which depart but no transpond not talk atc . aircraft wa a vfr descent nantucket airport . nantucket ati wa report that runway 24 30 use arriv runway 15 vfr departur . nantucket tower wa also dual control . At about 15 mile away arriv airport cape approach ; who wa give flight ; hand off nantucket tower . upon check first tower frequenc ; told fli northern shorelin a right base entri runway 24 . We also advis that a piper malibu airport by nantucket tower . after acquir aircraft runway 24 I continu finish checklist set up aircraft arriv airport . At thi point pilot fli wa scan area traffic then observ anoth aircraft 2 3 o'clock posit about 30 - 50 FT off right wing no more 100 FT below current altitud . see aircraft wa a descent set a collis cours other aircraft . pilot fli call traffic then start abrupt climb avoid aircraft . after clear outbound traffic report traffic tower . tower report that they did not have a transpond return aircraft . therefor never receiv a traffic call or a tca report aircraft . We also did not hear ani commun aircraft . 1 ) nantucket tower did not advis ani conflict traffic . 2 ) aircraft either did not have transpond or wa not function properli . 3 ) departur off runway 15 be told make right turn fli overhead north avoid ifr depart traffic runway 24 ; but into vfr arriv runway 24 . 
563,1,1100,A pa28 pilot report airborn conflict anoth light aircraft a short flight bed bo . crowd airspac wa a contribut factor . I wa second departur a seri four : anoth piston singl ; me ; by a turbo prop a small jet . I wa instrument flight plan clear depart runway 29 a left turn 250 issu hold line . tower alert me traffic bound traffic left downwind . I depart ; roughli 1 ; 100 msl ; I initi my left turn 250 . bed tower then gave me immedi hand-off boston approach . As I wa tune radio 124.4 I lower nose check traffic . I then saw a [ high wing light aircraft ] zip by roughli 500 FT horizont distanc roughli 150 200 FT vertic distanc . [ other aircraft ] did n't appear have taken ani evas action . I did not either ; as nearli orthogon cours . neither bedford tower befor hand off nor boston approach after hand off call ani specif traffic . On my departur I never downwind traffic bed tower call out sight . I also never told them I traffic . they pass traffic alert my departur clearanc I wa still ground hold short runway 29 . despit be a flight instructor ; have remind traine mani occas that depart ifr flight plan doe n't reliev pilot full traffic awar when vmc ; I allow my focu ifr procedur dure a vmc departur unfamiliar airport interfer reduc amount time I spent look out window traffic . I wa focus my vector bosox intersect ; hand off boston approach not enough look traffic . I am glad that I lower nose took a look ; but overal my eye insid too much . also ; as I have told mani traine ; pilot workload is higher ifr departur vmc becaus you have do all ifr cockpit task ; but also all vfr traffic avoid task . I am lucki that miss each other . thi experi is a valuabl person teach moment one that I can use construct my student . 
564,3,3500,A pa28 passeng detect converg traffic 3 ; 500 FT near 8b1 as pilot wa look chart frequenc so pilot took evas action avoid other aircraft by 400 FT . I wa fli a cheroke southeast bound 3 ; 500 FT a flight 2b3 ash . when I pass abeam 8b1 ; I began verifi frequenc my chart tune radio prepar contact boston approach . I wa requir contact boston approach becaus rout flight would take through edg manchest class C airspac prior enter nashua class D. I wa perform thi task ; a passeng remark that there wa a 'big airplan right . ' I look up saw a single-engin retractable-gear converg my 1 o'clock about a half mile ; northeast bound ; or slightli abov my altitud . I immedi pitch down turn right so as pass below behind converg traffic . other airplan made no appar chang altitud indic 3 ; 100 FT ; so vertic separ wa about 400 FT I estim horizont separ wa about same . both aircraft oper appropri altitud direct flight . aircraft my right right way thank my observ passeng I wa abl see yield that aircraft . upon reflect howev ; there are still lesson be learned:1 . A traffic alert system ; whether on-board electron system ; atc flight ; or observ passeng ; contribut see avoid concept greatli increas safety.2 . complex cockpit task ; such as find tune multipl radio frequenc should be divid into smaller task so that pilot can avoid longer period 'head-down ' time therebi scan traffic more frequent ; and3 . although pilot receiv train scan traffic practic maneuv that requir immedi pilot input ; such as go-around ; stall recov ; recoveri critic attitud ; no time can I rememb receiv train traffic avoid maneuv cruis speed . such train might be benefici . Of cours ; it would alway be better practic item 1 & 2 resolv conflict sooner . 
565,2,750,A lancair pilot depart a ifr flight plan experienc nmac a cessna singl fli a practic approach a differ runway . after take off runway 23 ifr flight I wa clear climb runway head 2 ; 000 msl . climb through 750 msl tca call traffic dead ahead about same time as spot a high wing cessna right ahead . We broke right narrowli avoid him . We no warn tower about potenti conflict . control wa veri busi mani aircraft train situat enter exit [ hi airspac ] . In talk tower supervisor later it appear cessna wa a practic approach drift across end runway . I do n't think tower control should have allow practic approach ( anoth runway ! ) dure such a busi time . He should have appreci that they could drift into a conflict should have warn me potential.on addit factor is that lancair evolut is a veri high perform airplan control may have been unfamiliar not realiz how fast would go onc releas . 
566,5,5000,A pilot practic profici maneuv 5 ; 000 FT prior a vfr approach pym ha a near miss aircraft which he assum wa ifr becaus it wa not pym ctaf . I wa return a vfr cross countri flight a friend passeng seat . plane wa a garmin gns430 a mode C transpond ; use ctaf frequenc pym time . We plan enter traffic pattern pym . there wa a lot aircraft fli under 2 ; 000 FT msl . A plane call a 4 mile final into runway 15 ; close that area decid do a climb turn look traffic . wind start shift favor [ runway ] 24 but other aircraft pattern not chang runway . We decid climb up about 5 ; 000 FT msl over shore line do a few practic maneuv wait let other aircraft land or chang runways.w did clear turn did a few chandel ; steep turn ; lazi eight . On last lazi eight ; as 're return wing level see aircraft fli veri close right under left wing . It seem be about 300 FT below within 200 FT horizont ; it might have been closer ; but rate that it flew under it wa veri difficult tell . I appli full power made a 60 degre bank right turn immedi tri avoid thi aircraft . We thought it wa a light twin . It look like it made no effort evad . they must have been atc ; as they 5 ; 000 FT go least 150 kt ; which would put them boston bravo a matter minut . after thi event ; pattern wa clear made unev land . I do n't know what wa go other aircraft ; but chang attitud my aircraft lazi eight ; close speed conflict traffic ; left about a second react turn . light twin be fast ; rel small ; blind spot under nose wa abl get too close without see them . ads-b would have been invalu thi situat ; as would be abl see other aircraft display quicker easier tri spot it whilst perform a maneuv . 
567,1,1100,pa28 pilot a right dowinwind report a nmac pattern mvi aircraft cross a right base . tower did not advis either pilot impend conflict . I wa work cape approach enrout mvi southwest . cape hand me off tower who advis me report a right downwind entri . my direct flight a right base would have been a better line up . I request a right base wa grant same . there multipl aircraft area both land takeoff . It becam clear as I approach that a right base would put me conflict anoth aircraft a right base further out my left . I advis tower that I thought a right downwind would fact be better he concur I alter cours right downwind . approach establish parallel runway right downwind or near pattern altitud tower control request I extend my downwind other aircraft . I acknowledg same . In a split second out corner my eye I saw anoth aircraft my left ( aircraft Y ) a right base . aircraft Y pass underneath me by a veri slim margin ; 200 feet ; perhap 100 feet . It wa veri quick . If been same altitud would have collid . I advis tower control event onli respons wa 'that 's whi I told you extend downwind ' airport went quiet extrem busi a veri short period time . I am not sure if control did not know aircraft Y 's posit or if I misinterpret my instruct but if latter I did repeat everyth I believ control acknowledg same . I wa expect aircraft Y be insid my posit not outsid my posit . My attent wa focus toward airport onli occasion glanc my left . I wa ask onc again extend downwind continu downwind fall behind a pc-12 final ; rest flight wa unev . I do n't know how pilot aircraft Y could have miss me ; I wa right front him . My onli explan is that he may have been look hi right me ; think I wa more abeam tower area right downwind .

570,10,2900,pa28 pilot report nmac a learjet departur bdr . I wa climb dure a straight-out departur runway 29 bridgeport airport . I wa 2900 feet msl ; head 290 degre . I look out my left window dure a scan traffic ; saw a learjet about 150 feet away ; my altitud ; also head a westerli direct ; a slight left bank.i am quit certain thi learjet also just depart bridgeport soon after I ; becaus I rememb see aircraft ground bridgeport wait takeoff clearanc as I wa take off . I assum ; but do not know certain ; that lear also request a straight-out departur runway 29 ; overtaken me becaus hi higher speed . I assum lear pilot may have seen me therefor wa bank left avoid my aircraft ; but I also do n't know if that is true . It may have been luck that he bank when he did ; or I believ hi aircraft may have collid mine.i believ onli way have avoid thi near-miss wa tower not have allow lear perform a straight-out departur so soon after a slower aircraft ( my aircraft ) depart a straight-out departur . again ; I do not know sure if learjet made a straight-out departur ; or if he come so close behind me dure maneuv after some other type departur . all I know sure is he came behind wa veri close when I final saw him my left . 
571,6,2200,carrier first offic report navig problem aros final bo runway 27 they continu a visual land after atc cancel their approach clearanc due traffic runway 33l . We setup il 27 approach into bo . they also land 33l . final approach control issu maintain 170 kt ripit ( faf ) dure approach receiv red X 's 3 time which would indic local is n't work instrument . thi happen outsid faf visual could maintain a visual airport that decid that would n't go around becaus it wa vmc . We continu approach . final ask what speed do . I repli 170 kt . He then came back said space would n't work even if slow it would n't work . cancel approach clearanc turn right 360 maintain 2000 that he would sequenc back . My captain then repli over radio 'unabl given red x 's are have navig problem . ' after a few second captain then said 'we broke out need continu approach ' ( alreadi visual ) . final say traffic look out 11 o'clock 800 ft. captain repli traffic insight . final say maintain a visual traffic clear il 27 . I then repeat back maintain visual clear approach . final ask if have issu navig . I repli are visual airport . final hand off tower . thi whole exchang last over 30 second when he ask how fast go until got hand off tower . We 3.6 dme il when other aircraft land . red X 's appear around 13.5 11.5 dme . upon taxi ground a number captain call . captain call number then after some time refer guy chief pilot I wa n't abl hear what whole convers entail I just heard what captain said person .
