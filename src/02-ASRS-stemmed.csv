WHILE TURNING RIGHT FROM A HDG OF 246 DEGS TO HDG 330 DEGS; WELL INTO THE RIGHT HAND TURN; THE CONVERGING TFC APPEARED; TAKING UP THE MAJORITY OF THE WINDSHIELD OF THE SMA I WAS FLYING; APPROX 20-30 YDS AWAY. I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY EXECUTING A QUICK CLBING RIGHT TURN. IT APPEARED THE SMT TOOK NO EVASIVE ACTION IN THIS INCIDENT. I BELIEVED THE SITUATION OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED VIS DUE TO THE SUN AND BECAUSE OF THE VECTOR BRADLEY APCH ISSUED ME. THE ALTIMETER SETTING I WAS GIVEN WAS 30-59 (BY BRADLEY); THE SMT WAS SAID TO BE VFR. I WAS SHOWING A LNDG LIGHT AT THE TIME AND I WAS TRANSPONDER EQUIPPED WITH MODE C. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: THE RPTR FILED A NEAR MISS RPT WITH THE FAA AND HAS BEEN ADVISED THEY ARE CONTACTING THE OTHER PLT. RPTR HAS ALSO SENT A LETTER REQUESTING THE RESULTS OF THEIR INVESTIGATION.

2,800,2,I WAS INVOLVED IN A NMAC WHILE ON FINAL APCH TO RWY 24 AT PYM. I WAS CONDUCTING A PLT CHK FLT WITH A PVT PLT WISHING TO HAVE RENTAL PRIVILEGES AT THE FBO/FLT SCHOOL WHERE I AM A PART TIME CFI. I CAN ONLY ASSUME I WAS INVOLVED IN A MIDAIR NEAR MISS BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THE OTHER ACFT IN SIGHT. BUT; I ASSUME IT DID HAPPEN BASED ON THE STATEMENT OF THE PLT OF THE OTHER ACFT. WHILE TAXIING TO THE ACTIVE RWY I ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM WITH THE PLYMOUTH UNICOM THAT THE ACFT RADIO WAS OPERATING PROPERLY. I NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THEM TO MY REQUEST FOR A RADIO CHK. I ASSUMED THE ACFT RADIO WAS NOT TRANSMITTING BUT DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE FLT SINCE USE OF A RADIO IS NOT REQUIRED AT UNCTLED ARPTS. TO HELP PLTS SEE US BETTER; I TURNED ON THE ACFT'S NAV; STROBE AND LNDG LIGHTS AND LEFT THEM ON THROUGHOUT THE FLT. ALSO; I DID BROADCAST MY POS ANYWAY WHILE OPERATING IN THE TFC PATTERN. DURING THE THIRD LNDG WE TURNED; AND AFTER BEING ESTABLISHED ON A BASE LEG I HEARD THE PLT OF AN SMA Y BROADCAST HE WAS ALSO ON BASE. I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HIM. ONCE MY ACFT WAS ON FINAL; A FEW SECS LATER; I HEARD HIM BROADCAST THAT HE WAS GOING AROUND. AT THIS POINT I STILL DID NOT SEE SMA Y AND PROCEEDED WITH THE LNDG. ONCE ON THE RAMP AND AFTER HE SHUT DOWN; HE CAME OVER TO ME AND EXPLAINED HOW CLOSE WE HAD COME. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I SHOT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. SINCE WE WERE BOTH FLYING LOW WINGED ACFT; I CAN ONLY COME UP WITH ONE EXPLANATION. IF I WAS UNDER AND BEHIND HIM; I WOULD HAVE HAD TO SEE HIM. MY EXPLANATION IS THAT WE WERE ALREADY ON FINAL AND PROCEEDING TOWARD THE RWY AT ABOUT 70 KTS; THE FINAL APCH SPD OF SMA Y IS 63 KTS. THE SMA X WITH AN APCH SPD RECOMMENDED BY ACFT MFTR IS 75 KTS; WAS TURNING BASE TO FINAL. OUR SPD TOWARD THE RWY WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM LIKE WE OVERTOOK THE ACFT; BUT AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. FORTUNATELY NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED. SINCE MY ACFT WAS UNDER THE SMA Y AND ON FINAL WE HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY. THE PLT OF THE SMA Y RPTED A NMAC RPT WITH THE NE FSDO OFFICE. SINCE I WAS IN THE RIGHT SEAT; THE BASE TO FINAL TURN WOULD HAVE POSITIONED THE ROOF OF THE SMA X TO BLOCK ANY TFC ABOVE US. OUR APCH SPDS WERE APPROX 70 KTS OR LOWER; SINCE I INSIST ON THIS WITH STUDENTS AND WAS PAYING PARTICULAR ATTN TO HOW THE PVT PLT I WAS CHKING WAS HANDLING THE ACFT.

I wa conduct A plt chk flt A pvt plt wish TO have rental privileg AT fbo/flt school where I AM A part time cfi .

I never receiv A respons them TO MY request A radio chk . I assum acft radio wa not transmit but decid TO continu flt sinc use OF A radio IS not requir AT unctl arpt . TO help plt see US better ; I turn ON acft 'S nav ; strobe lndg light left them ON throughout flt . also ; I did broadcast MY po anyway oper IN tfc pattern . dure third lndg WE turn ; after be establish ON A base leg I heard plt OF AN sma Y broadcast HE wa also ON base .

AT thi point I still did not see sma Y proceed lndg . onc ON ramp after HE shut down ; HE came over TO ME explain how close WE come . HE also told ME that I shot out under him . sinc WE both fli low wing acft ; I can onli come UP one explan . IF I wa under behind him ; I would have TO see him . MY explan IS that WE alreadi ON final proceed toward rwi AT about 70 kt ; final apch spd OF sma Y IS 63 kt . sma X AN apch spd recommend BY acft mftr IS 75 kt ; wa turn base TO final . spd toward rwi would certainli seem like WE overtook acft ; but AT that time WE would have been travel IN differ direct . fortun NO accid occur . sinc MY acft wa under sma Y ON final WE right OF way . plt OF sma Y rpted A nmac rpt NE fsdo offic . sinc I wa IN right seat ; base TO final turn would have posit roof OF sma X TO block ani tfc abov US . apch spd approx 70 kt OR lower ; sinc I insist ON thi student wa pay particular attn TO how pvt plt I wa chking wa handl acft . all 3 time WE flew tfc pattern proper alt ; turn ; etc ; made ,CLOSE PROX 2 GA-SMA ACFT IN TRAFFIC PATTERN AT PLM.

WE CONTACTED QUONSET TRACON ON 133.85; REQUESTED AND WERE GRANTED 'DIRECT PVD.' AS OUR POS WAS SOMEWHAT S AND W OF THE ARPT; AND THE LNDG RWYS WERE 23L/23R; WE WERE GIVEN A VECTOR ON A 050 DEG HDG AND TOLD TO DSND TO 5000'; AT WHICH TIME ALL LNDG LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED.

HE TOLD US WE WERE CLRED FOR THE VISUAL TO RWY 23L AND TO STAY WITH HIM. AT THIS TIME; WE WERE ADVISED THAT THERE WAS TFC 2 MI N OF THE ARPT AT 1800'. NO FURTHER INFO ABOUT THIS ACFT WAS GIVEN. WE PROCEEDED INBND TO THE ARPT ON APPROX A 070 DEG HDG. AT THIS POINT WE WERE APPROX 1-2 NM W OF THE ARPT AND WERE UNABLE TO CONTACT THE CTLR WHO WAS TALKING TO ANOTHER ACFT. AT A POINT APPROX 2 MI N OF THE ARPT; AND ON APPROX A 075 DEG HDG; WE SAW SMA Y; APPARENTLY A TFC RPTR. AT THE TIME I SAW ACFT Y HE WAS AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS AND LESS THAN 1 MI; AT THE SAME ALT; OPP DIRECTION. WE ALTERED COURSE TO THE LEFT AND PASSED BY THE ACFT.

WE CALLED THE TWR; ADVISED THAT WE HAD JUST BEEN TURNED OVER TO HIM BY QUONSET. WE WERE CLRED TO LAND. AFTER LNDG; I CALLED BOTH PVD TWR AND QUONSET TRACON. THE TWR PERSONNEL SEEMED RATHER PUT OUT THAT QUONSET HAD NOT TURNED OUR FLT OVER TO THE TWR EARLIER.

7,10700,10,I WAS FLYING THE ACFT AT 11000' MSL LEVEL FLT AIRSPD 250 KTS. THE CAPT WAS WORKING THE RADIOS. ATC ADVISED; 'TFC 10-11 O'CLOCK; 6 MI; 10000' SWBOUND; UNVERIFIED.' OUR CREW THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT THE TFC WAS NOT AT A VFR ALT. WE ALL LOOKED FOR THE TFC. ATC: 'TFC NOW (BROKEN XMISSION) MI 10500' TURNING WBOUND.' S/O OR JUMPSEAT RIDER: 'THERE; 11 O'CLOCK; JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON.' THE CAPT STATED; 'WATCH HIM; HE'S CLBING.' THE ACFT APPEARED TO BE A LIGHT TWIN ENG ACFT. ATC: '10700.' THE ACFT WAS WINGS LEVEL OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR ACFT; AT WHAT LOOKED LIKE THE SAME ALT. I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT TWIN MAKE A VERY STEEP RIGHT TURN. THE CAPT STATED; 'HE'S GOING TO MISS US!' THE ACFT PASSED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR ACFT. THE CAPT STATED TO BOS CENTER; 'DAMN; THAT WAS TOO CLOSE.' ATC RESPONDED THAT 'HE HOPED THE TARGET HAD US VISUALLY.' I FEEL BOS CENTER FELT; ON THE FIRST CALLOUT; THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A CONFLICT WITH THE TFC. ATC REALIZED THE PROB WHEN THE TARGET TURNED WBOUND AND BEGAN TO CLB. I DON'T THINK ATC HAD TIME TO VECTOR US AWAY FROM THE TFC AND THAT HE DID THE PROPER THING BY KEEPING US INFORMED OF THE TARGET'S ALT AND HDG. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 85767: ATC: '10700';' TARGET NOT IDENTED BY HEAD ON PROFILE AS A LIGHT TWIN; WINGS LEVEL AT LEFT SIDE OF MY WINDSHIELD AT OUR ALT. I REACHED FOR THE YOKE TO BREAK RIGHT; (F/O STATED LATER HE WAS ABOUT TO ALSO) BUT SAW THE TWIN MAKE A VERY STEEP RIGHT BANK; AND I STATED; 'HE'S GOING TO MISS US!' TWIN PASSED MY LEFT SLIDING WINDOW SHOWING US HIS UNDERSIDE. AS I FOLLOWED THE SMT Y LOOKING AFT; HE APPEARED TO LEVEL HIS WINGS AND APPEARED TO PASS BEHIND US. I STATED TO ATC; 'DAMN; THAT WAS TOO CLOSE;' AND ATC ANSWERED TO THE EFFECT THAT HE HAD HOPED THE TARGET HAD US VISUALLY. I BELIEVE THAT ATC FELT; THE SAME AS I DID; THAT ON THE FIRST CALLOUT THERE WOULD BE NO CONFLICT; (IE; THE SMT Y HDG SW WOULD PUT HIM FAR TO OUR RIGHT WHEN OUR PATHS CONVERGED).

WE RESPONDED; 'NO JOY.' 30 SECS LATER WE; COPLT AND MYSELF; SPOTTED TFC 12 O'CLOCK AT OUR ALT LESS THAN 1000' PASSING W TO E. WE HARDBANKED LEFT; HE DID THE SAME; PASSING OFF RIGHT WING TIP. APCH ASKED THE ACFT; A TWIN ENG SMT; WHAT HIS ALT WAS. NO ANSWER. HE ASKED AGAIN; NO ANSWER. WE WERE SWITCHED OVER TO TWR CTL AND HEARD NOTHING MORE. FLT CREWS FIRST LEG TOGETHER WITH NO PROBS. THE WX WAS A LOW LYING HAZE; TOPS ABOUT 2000'. WHY THEN DIDN'T WE SEE THE TFC? THREE SETS OF EYES WERE LOOKING FOR HIM. BETTER YET; WHY DIDN'T HE SEE US? ALL LIGHTS WERE ON ON A FAIRLY LARGE ACFT (LGT)? CORRECTIVE ACTION TO THE LEFT BECAUSE OF HIS DIRECTION OF FLT. IF WE TURNED RIGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS. IT SEEMS A TCA WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY HELPED. I THINK ATC IS CUTTING ACFT TOO CLOSE TO ACCOMMODATE TOO MANY ACFT AT ONE TIME--ESPECIALLY GA AND TRANSPORT. THEY MUST REMEMBER WHO PAYS TO USE THE ARPTS AND GIVE PRIORITY TO THE TRANSPORTS. LET'S RECOMMEND TO KEEP THE F/E'S POS FOR IF EVEN THE SIMPLE FACT OF 3 SETS OF EYES ARE BETTER THAN 2.

I SAW ANOTHER ACFT COMING FROM THE LEFT; (WHO WAS ON LOC AT 5000) I ASKED APCH SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THIS OTHER ACFT; BUT HE WAS TOO BUSY TO RESPOND. ONCE HE DID RESPOND HE ABRUPTLY SAID MAINTAIN 6000'.WE WERE AT 5600' DESCENDING AND CLIMBED BACK TO 6000'.

10,1500,7,THE WX WAS RPTED VFR 20 SCATTERED; 250 SCATTERED. ONE ACFT VECTORED FOR ILS 4R; THE OTHER VECTORED FOR VISUAL APCH TO 4L. CLOUD LAYER MOVED IN. THE SEVERITY OF THE CLOUD LAYER WAS NOT MADE CLEAR. ATC WAS MISTAKEN AS TO THE VMA IN THE AREA AND DSNDED ACFT ON VISUAL APCH TO WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS MVA IN ORDER TO GET BELOW CLOUDS. THE SEP BTWN ACFT ON VISUAL APCH AND ACFT ON ILS APCH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LOST. THIS INFO CAME TO LIGHT AFTER NTAP. IN THE CTLR'S JUDGEMENT; SEP WAS NOT LOST. SEP WAS ALSO LOST BTWN THE ACFT ON VISUAL APCH ON AND TERRAIN. THE SOLUTION TO THE PROB IS TO MAKE CTLRS MORE AWARE OF WX AND HOW QUICKLY AND SEVERELY IT CAN MOVE IN. ADDITIONALLY; THE ACFT ON VISUAL APCH NEVER MADE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THE CLOUDS; WHICH LED THE CTLR TO BELIEVE THE CLOUDS WERE JUST A SCATTERED LAYER AND NOT A FACTOR TO A GOOD; SAFE VISUAL APCH. THE PLT WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS ON VECTORS FOR THE VISUAL APCH. ALSO; TRNING SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CTLRS TO REFRESH MEMORIES ABOUT MVA'S; AS SOMETIMES WE TEND TO DO THINGS BY ROTE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: RPTR CTLR WAS VECTORING AN ACR MLG FOR A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 4L AND; THINKING THE MVA WAS 1500' WITH A SCATTERED CLOUD LAYER AT 2000'; DSNDED THE MLG TO 1500' IN AN AREA OF 1800 MVA. THAT WAS ERROR #1.

I INITIATED EVASIVE ACTION (DESCENT AND TURN TO THE RIGHT) AND WE PASSED WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET OF THE SMA. I BELIEVE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE NEAR-MISS WAS REDUCED VIGILANCE OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT WHILE DEALING WITH THE DISTR OF THE REQUIRED CHECKLIST. THE APCH CTLR NEVER CALLED THE TFC OUT TO US - PROBABLY BECAUSE HE HIMSELF WAS VERY BUSY WITH IFR TFC AND PROVIDING RADAR ADVISORIES TO NUMEROUS VFR ACFT.

14,6400,20,FLT FROM PORTLAND; ME; WAS APPROX 20 MI OUT OF BOSTON; DSNDING THROUGH ABOUT 6400' AT 250 KTS ASSIGNED TO INTERCEPT THE ILS RWY 27 LOC WHEN I SPOTTED AN ACFT AT ABOUT THE 10:30 POS ON A COLLISION COURSE. THE ACFT HAD AN SMA TYPE OF PROFILE; BUT LOOKED BIGGER AND I JUDGED IT TO BE AT THE SAME ALT WE WERE AND AT MOST 1-2 MI AWAY. THERE WAS NO TIME TO TURN. I CLOSED THE THROTTLES IMMEDIATELY AND PUT THE PLANE INTO A DIVE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE. IT APPEARED THAT THE OTHER ACFT STARTED TO CLB AND ITS RIGHT WING WENT UP. ITS DIRECTION OF FLT WAS TOWARD THE NNE; WHILE WE WERE COMING FROM THE E AND EITHER ON THE RWY 27 LOC OR ABOUT TO INTERCEPT IT. THE WHOLE INCIDENT HAPPENED SO FAST (ABOUT 5-15 SECS) THAT THE F/O DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE OTHER ACFT UNTIL IT WAS PASSING DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. HE ESTIMATED ITS CLRNC TO BE 100-200'. ABOUT 20 SECS LATER; I REGAINED ENOUGH COMPOSURE TO ASK APCH CTL WHY THEY HAD NOT CALLED OUT THAT TFC. APCH CTL REPLIED THAT THE OTHER ACFT WAS 900' ABOVE US AND THAT SHE HADN'T SEEN IT. 'IT'S OUTSIDE THE TCA;' SHE ADDED. HER TONE OF VOICE CLEARLY IMPLIED; 'BIG DEAL! WHAT'S YOUR PROB?' OF COURSE BY THEN THE OTHER ACFT WOULD BE HIGHER THAN US; HE WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL CLBING AT MAX RATE AND WE WERE DSNDING AS SHARPLY AS WE COULD W/O TURNING THE AIRPLANE UPSIDE DOWN. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHY I HAD NOT SPOTTED THE OTHER ACFT SOONER. IT ALL HAPPENED WITH SUCH STARTLING SPD THAT I CANNOT EVEN SAY WHETHER IT FIRST APPEARED IN THE FRONT OR THE SIDE WINDOW. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE METAL FRAME SEPARATING THE 2. WE CONTINUED IN TO LAND AT BOS W/O FURTHER INCIDENT. THERE WAS NO INJURY TO PAX OR CREW; BUT THE F/A'S ALL STATED THAT THEY NOTICED THE SHARP PITCHOVER AND THAT IF THEY HADN'T BEEN STRAPPED IN THEIR SEATS; THEY WOULD HAVE COME OFF THE FLOOR. I AM SURE THEY WOULD HAVE; BUT A MIDAIR COLLISION WAS AVOIDED. THE CTLR IN THIS INSTANCE WAS BUSY AND AS SHE POINTED OUT; WE WERE OUTSIDE THE TCA. IT IS COMFORTING TO KNOW THAT SHE WAS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR POINTING OUT VFR TFC. AS A P.S.; I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHILE CLBING OR DSNDING; A PLT'S JUDGEMENT OF VERT SEP IS AS LEAST IMPAIRED AND MAY BE COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS. IT WOULD NOT BE ACCURATE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY HIT. WITH THE HORIZON DISPLACED ON THE WINDSHIELD DUE TO THE DSCNT AND SOMEWHAT OBSCURED DUE TO A SLIGHT HAZE; ANY ESTIMATE OF OUR INITIAL VERT SEP COULD HAVE TAKEN A FEW SECS; AND AT THAT CLOSURE RATE; YOU DO NOT HAVE SEVERAL SECS TO INITIATE ACTION. I RECALL AN ACCIDENT SOME 30 YRS AGO WHERE AN ACFT DEPARTING NY SBND AT NIGHT BECAME INVERTED IN ITS ATTEMPT TO MISS THE APCHING LNDG LIGHTS OF ANOTHER PLANE THAT WAS ACTUALLY 1000 OR MORE FT VERT SEPARATED FROM HIM.

I INITIATED A RIGHT TURN; AS DID THE JET. CLOSEST APCH I ESTIMATED AT 3 MI OR SO. THE JET CONTINUED ITS CLB AND I RESUMED COURSE AS SOON AS WE WERE CLR. POINT TO BE MADE: A JET CLBING AT PERHAPS 200 KTS AND 2000 FPM COVERS 3 MI IN 2000' OF CLB. POTENTIALLY AT AN APPARENTLY SAFE DISTANCE ABOVE CLOUDS OF 2000+'; IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE ONLY 1 MIN TO RESPOND TO A JET CLBING OUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS. WHEN FLYING VFR ON TOP OF A BROKEN OR OVCST LAYER; WITHIN 25 MI OF AN ARPT WITH JET TFC; BE SURE CONTACT IS MADE WITH APCH CTL BY REQUESTING VFR ADVISORIES. IF UNABLE; THEN SKIRT THE AREA BY 25 MI MINIMUM. THIS OCCURRED AT A POS WHICH COINCIDES WITH A STRAIGHT CLBOUT FROM THE PROBABLE ACTIVE AT BRADLEY; RWY 24; BUT NOT ALL CLBOUTS ARE STRAIGHT OUT; SO ALL DIRECTIONS ARE POTENTIAL CONFLICT AREAS; AS I ESTIMATE; TO ABOUT 25 MI.,cpr-sma IS surpris BY AN acr-mlg climb rapidli out OF undercast .

36,1000,5,AS A MIL HELI PLT OPERATING OUT OF A MIL AIRFIELD; WE HAVE A TELEWRITER IN OUR FLT PLANNING ROOM THAT RELAYS THE CURRENT WX OBSERVATION AT THE AIRFIELD. BEFORE GOING OUT TO PERFORM A MAINT TEST FLT; I CONSULTED THE TELEWRITER AND THE WX WAS '8 BROKEN; 40 OVCST AND 5 MI VISIBILITY IN HAZE.' FIGURING THAT I COULD GET A SPECIAL VFR CLRNC WITHIN THE CTL ZONE; I PROCEEDED OUT TO THE ACFT. ON MY INITIAL CALL TO GND CTL; I WAS INFORMED THAT THE AIRFIELD WAS IFR. MY RESPONSE WAS THAT I WOULD LIKE A SPECIAL; AND THE TWR OPERATOR CAME BACK WITH; 'OH; I WAS WRONG--THE FIELD IS NOW VFR.' SO; I SAID THAT THAT WAS BETTER AND THAT I WOULD LIKE HOVER TAXI INSTRUCTIONS VFR LCL. ALSO AT THE AIRFIELD THERE ARE AIR NATL GUARD FGT'S AND COAST GUARD MLT'S AND MLT JETS. AT THE TIME THERE WAS AN MLT JET DOING APCHS TO RWY 23 AND FGT'S IN THE PATTERN. I DEPARTED OUT TO THE LCL TEST FLT AREA APPROX 5 MI W OF THE AIRFIELD AND CLBED TO 1000' MSL. UPON ARRIVING THERE; I CALLED APCH CTL AND ASKED FOR VFR ADVISORIES AND WAS GIVEN A SQUAWK. THE RADAR CTLR ADVISED THAT I WAS IN RADAR CONTACT. I THEN PROCEEDED TO DO THE TEST FLT CHKS. WHILE I WAS FLYING I MAINTAINED A LISTENING WATCH (JUST LIKE THE FAR/AIM SUGGESTS THAT YOU DO). THE RADAR CTLR TOLD THE MLT Y THAT; 'IN YOUR TURN TO THE NE; THERE WILL BE AN ARMY HELI AT YOUR 11 O'CLOCK 1000; 5 W OF THE AIRFIELD.' (THE '1000; 5W' PART WAS VERY RUN TOGETHER AND COULD HAVE BEEN MISCONSTRUED AS '1500.') THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT THE CTLR SAID! ALSO; THE MISSED APCH INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MLT Y JET WAS CLBING RIGHT HAND TURN TO 1800' FOR VECTORS BACK TO THE FINAL APCH COURSE. THE MLT Y CREW RESPONDED WITH; 'WE WON'T SEE THEM; THERE'S A LAYER BELOW US.' (I HEARD THIS TO BE; 'WE WON'T SEE THEM; THEY'RE BELOW US.') RIGHT AFTER THEY (THE MLT Y CREW) SAID THIS; THEY CAME OUT OF THE CLOUD LAYER IN A RIGHT HAND CLBING TURN. IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO BE A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. I ESTIMATED THAT THEY WERE APPROX 300-500' ABOVE US. I TERMINATED THE FLT VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT AND WENT TO THE RAPCON AT THE FIELD (WHICH IS AN FAA FAC). THE SUPVR AND THE CTLR WERE VERY APOLOGETIC. THE CTLR SAID THAT BECAUSE THE MLT Y CREW HAD RPTED THAT THERE WAS A LAYER BELOW THEM THAT THERE WAS NO NEED (IN HER EYES) TO ISSUE TFC TO ME BECAUSE I PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE THEM EITHER. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IF I WANTED TO ACCELERATE THE ISSUE; THAT I COULD FORMALLY FILE A RPT AND REQUEST AN 'ENTAP' WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AN ALT READOUT OF BOTH ACFT (IF THEY WERE HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE REMOTE SITE TO PICK BOTH OF THEM UP); AND COULD BE USED TO RECREATE BOTH FLT PATHS AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I GUESS THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS; DON'T EXPECT THE CTLRS TO SEE AND AVOID FOR YOU!,mlt X helicopt close TO arpt ; IN contact twr ; ha near miss mlt Y jet execut multipl instrument apch . AS A mil heli plt oper out OF A mil airfield ; WE have A telewrit IN flt plan room that relay current WX observ AT airfield . befor go out TO perform A maint test flt ; I consult telewrit WX wa '8 broken ; 40 ovcst 5 MI visibl IN haze . ' figur that I could get A special vfr clrnc within ctl zone ; I proceed out TO acft . ON MY initi call TO gnd ctl ; I wa inform that airfield wa ifr . MY respons wa that I would like A special ; twr oper came back ; 'oh ; I wa wrong -- field IS now vfr . ' SO ; I said that that wa better that I would like hover taxi instruct vfr lcl . also AT airfield there are natl guard fgt 'S coast guard mlt 'S mlt jet . AT time there wa AN mlt jet do apch TO rwi 23 fgt 'S IN pattern . I depart out TO lcl test flt area approx 5 MI W OF airfield clbed TO 1000 ' msl . upon arriv there ; I call apch ctl ask vfr advisori wa given A squawk . radar ctlr advis that I wa IN radar contact . I then proceed TO DO test flt chk . I wa fli I maintain A listen watch ( just like far/aim suggest that you DO ) . radar ctlr told mlt Y that ; 'in your turn TO NE ; there will BE AN armi heli AT your 11 o'clock 1000 ; 5 W OF airfield . ' ( '1000 ; 5W ' part wa veri run togeth could have been misconstru AS '1500 . ' ) thi IS what I thought ctlr said ! also ; miss apch instruct mlt Y jet wa clbing right hand turn TO 1800 ' vector back TO final apch cours . mlt Y crew respond ; 'we WO n't see them ; there 'S A layer below US . ' ( I heard thi TO BE ; 'we WO n't see them ; they 're below US . ' ) right after they ( mlt Y crew ) said thi ; they came out OF cloud layer IN A right hand clbing turn . IT look like they go TO BE A littl too close comfort . I estim that they approx 300-500 ' abov US . I termin flt veri shortli after that went TO rapcon AT field ( which IS AN faa fac ) . supvr ctlr veri apologet . ctlr said that becaus mlt Y crew rpted that there wa A layer below them that there wa NO need ( IN her eye ) TO issu tfc TO ME becaus I probabl would n't see them either . I wa also told that IF I want TO acceler issu ; that I could formal file A rpt request AN 'entap ' which would provid AN alt readout OF both acft ( IF they high enough remot site TO pick both OF them UP ) ; could BE use TO recreat both flt path see exactli what happen . I guess that bottom line IS ; DO n't expect ctlr TO see avoid you ! ,MLT X HELICOPTER CLOSE TO ARPT; IN CONTACT WITH TWR; HAS NEAR MISS WITH MLT Y JET EXECUTING MULTIPLE INSTRUMENT APCHS.

DUE TO LASER N ATACC BEING ACTIVE 100B FL500; I TURNED ACR Y HDG 080 DEGS TO GO E OF IT. THIS PUT THE 2 ACFT CLOSER TO EACH OTHER THAN IF ACR Y HAD REMAINED ON COURSE. WHEN THE ACFT WERE APPROX 15 MI APART; I TURNED MLT X (AT FL280) LEFT HDG 200 DEGS AND ACR Y (AT FL284) LEFT HDG 040 DEGS. ACR Y REQUESTED HDG AGAIN. I REISSUED IT AND DSNDED MLT X TO FL270.

38,200,1,UPON TERMINATING RADAR ADVISORIES WITH OTIS AFB ON 118.2; I CALLED HYANNIS TWR NOTIFYING THEM I WAS 5 MI NW WITH CURRENT INFO AND INTENT TO LAND. I WAS THEN GIVEN THE CHOICE OF ENTERING LEFT OR RIGHT DOWNWIND FOR RWY 33. I RESPONDED BY NOTIFYING THE TWR I WAS ENTERING LEFT DOWNWIND FOR RWY 33. WHILE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG PRIOR TO TURNING BASE; ANOTHER ACFT CALLED THE TWR REQUESTING A TOUCH AND GO ON RWY 33. THE TWR INFORMED THE OTHER PLT THEY WERE #2 AFTER THE SMA NOW ON DOWNWIND AND THIS XMISSION WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS BEING UNDERSTOOD. AFTER TURNING BASE FOR RWY 33 THE TWR AGAIN TOLD ME CLRED TO LAND AND AGAIN ADVISED THE OTHER PLT HE WAS #2 TO LAND. AT THIS TIME THE OTHER PLT RESPONDED BY ACKNOWLEDGING VISUAL CONTACT WITH MY ACFT AND HE WAS CLEAR TO PERFORM A TOUCH AND GO ON RWY 33. WHILE ON FINAL APCH THE SECOND ACFT LOST VISUAL CONTACT WITH MY ACFT AND ASSUMED I HAD LANDED AND WAS CLEAR OF THE RWY. WITHOUT THE TWR OR THE OTHER PLT REALIZING ACFT WAS DIRECTLY UNDER MY WING. DUE TO MY LOW WING AND THE OTHER CRAFT BEING A HIGH WING CONFIGN; NEITHER PLT WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THE OTHER. ON SHORT FINAL (1/8-1/4 MI) THE SECOND PLT CALLED THE TWR ASKING IF I WAS CLEAR THE RWY. AT THIS TIME THE TWR RESPONDED 'MY GOD; HE'S RIGHT ABOVE YOU; TURN LEFT AND CLIMB NOW. I WAS ALSO PREPARING TO EXECUTE A GO AROUND; BUT WAS TOLD CLEAR TO LAND. MY ALT AT THIS TIME WAS ABOUT 300' MSL; WHEN I OBSERVED THE OTHER CRAFT TURN; I WOULD ESTIMATE HIS ALT TO BE LESS THAN 100' BELOW ME. AFTER TAXIING TO THE PARKING AREA I NOTICED THE OTHER ACFT AGAIN EXECUTE A TOUCH AND GO ON RWY 33M; THEN LEAVE PATTERN. I FEEL THAT HAD THE OTHER PLT NOT CALLED THE TWR; WE WOULD HAVE COLLIDED ON THE RWY IN APPROX 20-30 SECONDS.,acft # 1 clear TO land ; acft # 2 told HE wa # 2 lndg . # 1 IN sight . acft 2 lost sight OF 1 ON final ; thought HE land . ask twr IF clear OF rwi . twr realiz acft both ON final ; one abov other . told 2 TO turn . upon termin radar advisori oti afb ON 118.2 ; I call hyanni twr notifi them I wa 5 MI NW current info intent TO land .

APCH CTL HAD NOT HANDED US OVER TO TWR SO WE CONTACTED THE TWR AND INITIATED A GO AROUND. INSTEAD OF OVERFLYING THE SMA I INITIATED A RIGHT TURN. I GOT NO REPLY FROM THE TWR SO I HAD F/O CONTACT APCH AND EXPLAIN OUR PREDICAMENT. AFTER VECTORS FOR ANOTHER APCH THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL. I CONTACTED THE TWR CTLR BY PHONE.

40,26400,10,I HAD ONE ACFT IN HOLDING OVER HYANNIS VOR AND ANOTHER HOLDING OVER ACK VOR. I WAS FORCED TO USE 2 FIXES BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO HOLD ALL THE ACFT AT HYA. THE 1ST ACFT (ACR X HOLDING AT HYA) OVERFLEW THE FIX IN HOLDING AND MADE A LEFT TURN INSTEAD OF RIGHT AT FL310. THE SECOND ACFT (ACR Y HOLDING AT ACK) ASKED FOR A REROUTE TO BRADLEY; CT.

43,3000,6,AT APPROX XX30; TWR REQUESTED HDGS FOR SUCCESSIVE DEPS ON RWY 35. I APPROVED HDGS 290 THROUGH 060. TWR RELEASED AN SMA HDG 060 DEG; 2 MI IN TRAIL AN SMA ON HDG 030 DEG; AND A THIRD SMA X ON HDG 360 DEG; ALL CLIMBING TO 3000'. NONE OF THE 3 SMA'S AUTOMATICALLY 'ACQUIRED'. MEANWHILE; I ADVISED MY FLT DATA MAN TO FORCE THE 3 SMA'S INTO THE ARTS AND FINALLY I HAD HIM MANUALLY 'DM' THE ACFT IN THE FDIO. WHILE HE WAS DOING THAT; I HAD MANUALLY COORDINATED WITH PSM APCH ON THE SMA'S. THE FIRST SMA I LEFT ON THE 060 DEG HDG FOR ENE AND CLIMBED HIM TO 9000. THE SECOND SMA; USING DIVERGENCE; WAS TURNED TO 090 DEG HDG; VECTORS TO INTERCEPT V106 AND CLIMBED TO 7000. THE THIRD SMA X WAS TURNED TO A 120 DEG HDG CLIMBING TO 5000' WHEN HE WAS 3 MILES NORTH OF THE RWY. LOCAL HAD RELEASED ATX Y ON A 060 DEG HDG CLIMBING TO 3000. I WAS COORDINATING HANDING OFF WITH PSM APCH ABOUT THE SMA'S AND MISSED ATX Y'S 'CHECK-ON'. SECONDS LATER ATX Y 'ACQUIRED' AT 3000'. I IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A TFC ALERT TO THE SMA X AND TURNED HIM 090 DEG TO MAINTAIN 3000. I THEN ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE CLIMB TO 5000 AND A 140 DEG HDG TO ATX Y.

46,5000,7,I WAS WORKING APPROX 6 ACFT AND QUICK LOOKING THE RADAR S POS. BECAUSE THERE WERE SEVERAL INBND ACFT FROM THE W; I HAD APPROVED A COUPLE OF POINTOUTS DSNDING INTO MHT. THE AIR TAXI WAS ENRTE DSNDING TO CROSS 7 DME NW OF THE LWM VOR TO MAINTAIN 5000'. I HAD AN SMA HDG NE BOUND AT 5000'. THERE WERE A LOT OF DATA TAGS AND CHATTER; CALLS COMING OVER THE LANDLINES; AND COORD IN THE BACKGROUND BECAUSE OF THE S POSITIONS TFC. WHEN I NOTICED THE AIR TAXI (APPROX 170 DEG HDG) AT 5500' DSNDING TO 5000'; PASSING OVER THE SMA AT 5000' (HDG APPROX 060 DEGS); TOLD THE AIR TAXI TO MAINTAIN 5000' BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY PASSING AND DIVERGING. NO FURTHER ACTIONS WERE NEEDED SINCE THE ACFT WERE ALREADY CLR. QUICK LOOKING THE S RADAR WAS A DISTR FROM MY TFC AND I MISSED THE CONFLICT ON MY SCAN OF THE TFC DUE TO THE NUMBERS OF DATA TAGS ON THE SCOPE. I BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD ONLY READOUTS ON THE TAGS OF THE ACFT THAT I HAD APPROVED POINTOUTS ON; MY SCOPE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO CLUTTERED WITH TAGS AND THE CONFLICTION WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN IN ADVANCE AND IN ENOUGH TIME TO AVOID THE LOSS OF REQUIRED SEP.,atx wa given A descent TO AN alt occupi BY anoth acft .

47,2800,15,WE HAD JUST COMPLETED THE NDB 35 PRACTICE APCH TO NORWOOD; MA. MY CHECK PLT IS A 600 HR PLT WITH 300 IN TYPE. NORWOOD TWR ISSUED US MISSED APCH INSTRUCTIONS TO TAKE UP A HDG OF 330 DEG FOR A RETURN VFR TRIP TO LAWRENCE; MA. ALTIMETER SETTING WAS FROM NORWOOD ATIS. WE PROCEEDED ON A 330 HDG AND WERE TOLD TO CONTACT BOSTON APCH FOR ADVISORIES; WHICH WE DID. WE CONTACTED BOSTON APCH AND INFORMED THEM OF OUR RETURN TO LAWRENCE. WE CLIMBED TO 2800' TO REMAIN CLEAR OF THE BOSTON TCA. UPON REACHING 2800' WE LEVELED FOR CRUISE. BOSTON INFORMED US OF AN AIR SHOW AT BEDFORD HANSCOM AND ADVISED US TO REMAIN WELL CLEAR OF THE HANSCOM ATA. JUST AFTER THAT ANOTHER ACFT WHICH I BELIEVE WAS AN MLT SINGLE ENGINE; GLASS COCKPIT; LOW WING; VINTAGE WWII ACFT WITH BLUE-GREY PAINT AND MIL MARKINGS CROSSED OUR PATH AT OUR ALT AND LESS THAN 50' AWAY. THE FLT PATH OF THE MLT WAS APPROX 15 DEG E OF OURS (ESTIMATE 345 DEG MAGNETIC) AND OVERTOOK US AT MUCH GREATER SPEED FROM OUR 7 O'CLOCK POSITION. MY ONLY MANEUVER WAS A SHORT; DIVING TURN TO THE RIGHT BUT WAS MORE REFLEX THAN EVASIVE. BY THE TIME I REACTED THE OTHER ACFT WAS ALREADY PAST. BOSTON ISSUED NO ADVISORIES. I INFORMED BOSTON APCH OF A NEAR MISS AND EXPLAINED OUR SITUATION. BOSTON SAID THEY NOW WERE TRACKING THE OTHER ACFT BUT WERE NOT IN CONTACT WITH THEM. BOSTON ASKED US TO CALL THE FAC WHEN WE LANDED; WHICH WE DID. I BELIEVE THAT WE DID EVERYTHING IN OUR CONTROL TO AVOID BOSTON'S TCA; USED EVERY AVAILABLE ASSISTANCE FROM APCH AND; WITH 2 PLTS ABOARD; PRACTICED PROPER SCAN TECHNIQUES AND SEE AND AVOID METHODS. I AM AMAZED THAT THE OTHER PLT COULD NOT SEE US. FROM THE DIRECTION WHICH HE OVERTOOK US; WE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS SIGHTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT TIME. MY COPLT EVEN COMMENTED THAT; HAD THIS BEEN A DOGFIGHT; THE OTHER ACFT WOULD HAVE HAD US IN PERFECT FIRING POSITION. I AM A BIT SURPRISED THAT BOSTON DID NOT CALL SUCH A TFC CONFLICT ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE JUL 1;30 MILE; MODE C REG WHICH WAS IN EFFECT.,nmac .

48,19600,20,AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS RPT; I WAS WORKING THE RADAR POS AT THE ALBANY SECTOR (22) AT BOS ARTCC. THE SECTOR WAS NOT COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS WAS STAFFED; HOWEVER THE RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR WAS DIVIDING HIS ATTN BTWN THE ALBANY SECTOR AND THE SYRACUSE SECTOR (23) WHICH HAD NO RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR AT THE TIME. I HAD BEEN WORKING THE POS FOR 1 HR AND 52 MINS WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS OF MENTAL FATIGUE; I HAD ADVISED THE AREA SUPVR THAT I WAS APCHING 2 HRS ON POS ABOUT 5 MINS BEFORE THE INCIDENT. ALTHOUGH NO OJT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE TIME; A FULL PERFORMANCE LEVEL CTLR WAS TRNING A DEVELOPMENTAL AT THE DELANCEY SECTOR (24) RADAR ASSOCIATE POS EARLIER IN THE PERIOD. ACR X; THE ACFT DESCRIBED ABOVE; HAD DEPARTED BDL ENRTE TO PIT. IT WAS PROCEEDING DIRECT CTR DIRECT HNK. SMT Y WAS EBND AT FL210; PROCEEDING DIRECT GDM TO LAND AT BVY. THIS ACFT; BY LCL PROC; HAD TO LEAVE MY AIRSPACE AT FL180. AFTER INITIALLY BECOMING AWARE OF ACR X; I DIVERTED MY ATTN TO SEEING THAT THE POINT-OUT AND HDOF COORD FOR 3 SUCCESSIVE ALB DEPS PROCEEDING NW HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. THESE ACFT ALSO HAD TO BE SEPARATED FROM AN ACFT NE BOUND AT FL210; AND NEEDING DSCNT TO LAND AT RUT. ACR X CHKED IN ON THE FREQ LEVEL AT 17000'. I CHKED HIS POS AND DIRECTION OF FLT; AND ENVISIONED A ROUTE CTR DIRECT CAM. WITH NO TFC ON THAT TRACK; I ISSUED CLRNC TO CLB AND MAINTAIN FL230 AND INITIATED A COMPUTER HDOF TO THE CAM SECTOR (39). SHORTLY THEREAFTER; I ISSUED CLRNC FOR SMT Y TO DSND AND MAINTAIN FL180. I THEN RETURNED MY ATTN TO THE ALB DEPS AND THE RUT INBND. AN INTERPHONE CALL DIRECTED MY ATTN TO THE NE QUADRANT OF MY SECTOR TO COORDINATE A PLT REQUEST FOR AN ACFT THEN AT FL240 ABOVE MY AIRSPACE. AN ADDITIONAL INTERPHONE CALL DIRECTED MY ATTN TO THAT QUADRANT TO APPROVE A REQUEST FOR CTL FOR ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS LEAVING MY AREA. I THEN RECEIVED AN INTERPHONE CALL FROM THE CAM SECTOR REQUESTING THAT I HDOF ACR X TO SECTOR 38. I THEN LOOKED BACK TO ACR X IN THE SE CORNER OF MY SECTOR AND OBSERVED C/A WITH SMT Y. I ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH ACFT TO TURN RIGHT. ACR X ACKNOWLEDGED AND BLOCKED THE PORTION OF MY XMISSION ADDRESSED TO SMT Y. A LOSS OF REQUIRED SEPARATION SUBSEQUENTLY OCCURRED.

49,3000,28,WE WERE CLRED TO GO OUTBND ON THE CTR 104 DEG R TO INTERCEPT THE GDM 28 DME ARC FOR THE VOR DME RWY 33 APCH INTO ORH (WORCESTER; MA). I REPORTED ARC INTERCEPTION AND WE WERE CLRED FOR THE APCH. THE CAPT HAD BRIEFED THAT UPON INTERCEPTION WE WERE CLRED TO 2500'. DISTRACTED BY WX CONCERNS (WE HAD ALREADY DEVIATED QUITE A BIT AND THE RADAR WAS REALLY LIT UP); I RECHECKED THE APCH PLATE; SAW '2500'; AND RESPONDED; '2500 LOOKS GOOD'. AFTER ROLLING OUT ON THE ARC; THE CAPT STARTED HIS DSCNT AND I REPORTED; 'OUT OF 4000; ON THE APCH'. THE IAF WAS AT THE INTXN OF THE GDM 179 DEG R AND THE 28 DME ARC WHICH I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE UNTIL THE SHARP CTLR TOLD US TO STOP OUR DSCNT AT 3000'. AFTER HEARING SOMETHING UNEXPECTED I LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AND FIGURED OUT MY MISTAKE. AFTER REACHING THE IAF WE MADE THE APCH BUT MISSED DUE TO POOR FLT VISIBILITY. THE MISTAKE: INCORRECT READING OF THE APCH PLATE AND SUBSEQUENT DSCNT BEFORE THE IAF. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) BAD WX; I.E.; TSTMS; 2) CREW FATIGUE; I.E.; NEXT TO LAST LEG ON THE 4TH DAY OF A 4 DAY TRIP; 3) INADEQUATE APCH BRIEFING.

50,39000,200,WHEN I RELIEVED SECTOR 17 (NANTUCKET SECTOR); ACR X WAS RELAYING THROUGH AN AIR CARRIER THAT HE WAS DEVIATING 20 DEG RIGHT OF COURSE FOR WX. ACR X WAS AT FL390 FLT PLANNED OVER SLATN AND REQUESTING CLIMB TO FL410 OR FL430. MY RA17 CTLR COORDINATED A CLIMB TO FL430 WITH THE NY OCEANIC CTLR AND I GAVE THE CLRNC TO THE ACFT. ACR X WAS CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR HIS RESPONSE. ACR Y CALLED ON FREQ AT FL390 AND HE WAS GOING OVER JOBOC. ACR Y ALSO WAS RADAR IDENTIFIED ABOUT 40 MI E OF JOBOC. 4 OR 5 MINS LATER I ASKED ACR X TO SQUAWK A CODE AND HE WAS IDENTIFIED AT FL430 RIGHT ON TOP OF ACR Y (ACR X HAD REPORTED REACHING FL430 4 OR 5 MINS PRIOR TO BEING IDENTIFIED). PREVIOUS TO IDENTING ACR X; 2 PRIMARY TARGETS WERE OBSERVED WITHIN 2-3 MI OF EACH OTHER; 50 MI E OF JOBOC. I DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE THE ACFT GOT BEFORE ACR X WAS OUT OF FL410 AS BOSTON ARTCC DOES NOT HAVE RADAR OR COMS VERY FAR E OF 6700 W LOG.,acr deviat around WX came IN close prox TO anoth acr over ocean . when I reliev sector 17 ( nantucket sector ) ; acr X wa relay through AN carrier that HE wa deviat 20 deg right OF cours WX . acr X wa AT fl390 flt plan over slatn request climb TO fl410 OR fl430 .

THE ACFT WAS ON A 280 DEG HDG 2 MI E OF MANCHESTER ARPT WHEN THE PLT ASKED IF I SAW AN SMT Y THAT JUST PAST IN FRONT OF HIM.

JUST W OF THE ARPT; THE WX WAS CLEARING BUT THE ARPT AND RWY WERE NOT VISIBLE. WE WERE CLRED FOR THE ILS APCH TO RWY 15 AND TOLD TO CALL THE MARKER INBND. CHECKING IN WITH THE TWR; WE WERE ADVISED TO WATCH FOR OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC ON THE ROLL RWY 33! WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT THE TFC WOULD MAKE A LEFT TURN SWBND.

54,5000,3,I WAS WORKING A POS THAT DEALS MAINLY WITH OVERFLTS. AN IFR SMT X AT 5000' WAS ON THE BDR 249 DEG R ABOUT 3 MI SW OF BDR. APPROX 9 MI IN TRAIL WAS AN CGA Y ON THE SAME ROUTE; SAME ALT. NOT REALIZING THE TYPE OR SPD OF THIS ACFT; I ACCEPTED THE HDOF. MEANWHILE; CGA Y CHKED IN WITH ME AND I GAVE HIM THE ALTIMETER SETTING AND WENT ON THE LANDLINES FOR SOME COORD. I WAS ON THESE LINES FOR SEVERAL MINS MAKING 3 MANUAL HDOFS; BECAUSE OF THE AUTOMATION BEING INTERMITTENT. IT TOOK APPROX 2 1/2 MINS FOR LOSS OF SEP TO OCCUR BTWN SMT X AND CGA Y. WHEN I CAME OFF THE LANDLINES; CGA Y CALLED ME; INQUIRING ABOUT THE SMT X OFF HIS RIGHT SIDE AND IF HE WAS IFR. I TOLD HIM YES. I DID NOT HEAR THE C/A GO OFF; ALTHOUGH IT DID.

55,21000,10,ACR X; AN MLG CLBING SWBND TO FL230. WORKING ANOTHER SECTOR I TOOK A POINTOUT ON. MY RADAR ASSOCIATE WORKING AT MY SECTOR WITH ME TOLD ME THAT ACR Y; AN MLG; WOULD BE HDG 110 DEGS AND DSNDING TO FL210. I THEN TOOK THE HDOF ON ACR X. THE TRACK WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE 110 DEG HDG. WHEN ACR X CAME ONTO THE FREQ; IT APPEARED TO BE TURNING TO A SE-ERLY DIRECTION. OUR RADAR TENDS TO JUMP AROUND A BIT; SO I ASKED MY 'RA' WHAT HE HAD APPROVED TO MAKE SURE. HE SAID THAT ACR X WAS HDG 150 DEGS; WHICH WASN'T GOOD. I TURNED ACR X LEFT TO A HDG OF 090 DEGS. THE PLT QUESTIONED THE TURN AND I THEN TURNED ACR X IMMEDIATELY LEFT; HDG 040 DEGS. STANDARD SEP WAS LOST AS THE ACFT PASSED ABOUT 3.5 MI FROM EACH OTHER GOING THROUGH FL210 CLBING AND DSNDING. THE PROB WAS THE NON UNDERSTANDING OF THE APPROVED HDG AND BDL VOR FOR BEING OTS DURING THE DAY. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 121282: A FACTOR WHICH I BELIEVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ERROR WAS WHEN THE PLT WAS GIVEN THE 40 DEG HDG; HE QUESTIONED WHY HE NEEDED TO TURN AND ASKED IF HE COULD DSND.

DESPITE OUR VIGILANT WATCH FOR TFC; THE ACFT WAS ABLE TO APCH UNDETECTED FROM OUR 1:30 POSITION; PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE POOR COCKPIT WINDOW DESIGN WHICH TENDS TO OBSCURE VIEWING IN THE 10-11 O'CLOCK 1-2 O'CLOCK POSITION.

WHEN ACR X WAS OVER THE ARPT AT 4000'; HE WAS GIVEN APCH CLRNC FOR THE NDB 29. THE CTLR WAS INFORMED BY ORH TWR THAT SMA Y WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE NDB. AT THIS TIME; THE CTLR INFORMED THE TWR TO CANCEL Y'S APCH CLRNC AND TURN HIM S OFF OF THE APCH. ONCE ACFT Y CAME ON THE CTLR'S FREQ; HE ENSURED THAT Y WAS SBND OFF OF THE APCH. THEN RECEIVING THE RPT FROM ACR X THAT HE WAS TURNING INBND; ACR X WAS SWITCHED TO THE TWR FREQ. THIS SITUATION HAPPENED IN A NON RADAR ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE CTLR SHOULD HAVE ENSURED THE POS OF THE FIRST ACFT BEFORE THE SECOND ACFT WAS GIVEN APCH CLRNC.

WE COULD SEE THE ARPT THOROUGH THE BROKEN CLOUD LAYER AS WE APCHED IT. WE WERE OVER THE ARPT WHEN WE WERE CLRED FOR THE NDB RWY 29 APCH. ABOUT THE TIME WE CROSSED OVER THE CROW HILL NDB OUTBND; THE CTLR TOLD US THERE WAS SMA Y IN THE VICINITY SWBND AT 2500'. THE CAPT WAS FLYING. HE REMAINED AT 3000' AS WE LOOKED FOR THE TFC.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 132172: I TOLD THE F/O TO ASK AS TO THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TFC; AND MEANWHILE ELECTED TO STAY AT 3000'.

79,31000,20,I WAS WORKING THE CAPE AND ACK SECTORS RADAR COMBINED AT SECTOR 17 AT THE BOSTON ARTCC. TWO OF THE SEVERAL ACFT I HAD ON FREQ; AN ACR X; LGT; BOS MVY MVY 260 J174 XXX DCA AND ACR Y; WDB; JFK ACK TUSKY VYSTA XXX EDDF. BOTH ACFT WERE CLIMBING ACR X TO FL310 AND ACR Y TO FL370. AT XXXX THE CONFLICT ALERT ACTIVATED ON MY RADAR SCOPE. AT XXXY I PLACED A 'J' RING ON ACR Y. UPON SEEING A POTENTIAL CONFLICT DEVELOPING I TURNED BOTH ACFT TO ENSURE SEPARATION. I TURNED ACR X WHO WAS ON AN ASSIGNED HDG OF 235 DEG TO INTERCEPT MVY 260 RADIAL TO A NEW HDG OF 255 DEG AND TURNED ACR Y 20 DEG TO THE RIGHT. AFTER OBSERVING THE VECTOR LENGTH IT APPEARED THAT ACR X HAD NOT MADE OR WAS NOT TURNED ENOUGH; SO I TURNED ACR X TO A NEW HDG OF 280 DEG. AFTER BOTH ACFT PASSED I SENT THEM ON THEIR RESPECTIVE ROUTES. ACCORDING TO THE OPERATIONAL ERROR DETECTION DEVICE I HAD 4.781 MI LATERAL SEPARATION AND EVEN WITH A 45 DEG TURN TO ACR X AND A 20 DEG TURN TO ACR Y THE SEPARATION REDUCED TO 4.0 MI BEFORE BOTH ACFT WERE CLEAR OF EACH OTHER. THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR CONFIGN HAS LED TO MANY OPERATIONAL ERRORS BECAUSE OF THE NARROW TUNNEL THROUGH WHICH BOS DEPS AND OVERSEAS CLIMBING TFC PASS IN CLOSE PROX TO EACH OTHER; APPROX 7 MI.

AFTER HAVING BEEN ON THIS 330 DEG HDG FOR 5-7 MINS; THE CTLR CAME ON THE AIR INSTRUCTING ACR X FLT DBE TO TURN TO A 270 DEG HDG AND DSND TO FL270; 'TFC ALERT!'. WE WERE ACR X FLT DBH; SO WE ASKED IF THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOR US. HE RESPONDED WITH 'ACR X DBH; TURN TO HDG 240 DEGS AND DSND IMMEDIATELY TO FL270--TFC ALERT; TFC AT 2 O'CLOCK; 7 MI; SAME ALT.'

CAPT DECIDED WE WERE TOO HIGH FOR THE APCH AND ELECTED TO PERFORM A LEFT 360 DEG TURN TO LOSE ALT. I WAS AWARE THAT ANOTHER ACFT Y HAD BEEN CLRED FOR APCH TO FOLLOW US. AS THE CAPT BEGAN HIS LEFT TURN HE INSTRUCTED ME TO NOTIFY THE TWR. DUE TO RADIO CONGESTION; I WAS NOT ABLE TO NOTIFY ATL UNTIL WE WERE 30-45 DEGS INTO THE TURN. THE TWR INSTRUCTED US TO EXECUTE A RIGHT 360 DEG TURN AND THEN REALIZED THAT WE WERE ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN THE LEFT TURN. HE THEN INSTRUCTED US TO FLY 270 DEGS AND MAINTAIN 2500'. I REPLIED THAT WE WOULD FLY 270 DEGS AND CLB TO 2500'. THE CAPT CONTINUED THE TURN TO ABOUT 240 DEGS UNTIL I TOLD HIM WE WERE TO FLY 270 DEGS. THE TWR CONTINUED TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE OTHER ACFT AND FINALLY INSTRUCTED HIM TO MAINTAIN VIS SEP FROM US. THE CAPT SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN I POINTED OUT THE TFC TO HIM AND WAS SURPRISED THAT THE TWR WAS NOT GOING TO LET US CONTINUE THE 360 DEG TURN AND COME RIGHT IN TO LAND.

IF WE HAD FOLLOWED HIS RECOMMENDATIONS; WE WOULD HAVE TURNED RIGHT INTO THE JET AND PROBABLY COLLIDED. AT THIS POINT; A NERVOUS SUPVR CAME ON THE FREQ AND RPTED THAT THE POP-UP TARGET HAD NOW DSNDED RAPIDLY OUT OF RADAR COVERAGE.

84,200,1,WAS IN POS AND HOLDING FOR TKOF ON RWY 33 AT BTV. LIGHT ACFT WAS IN THE PATTERN ON RWY 01 DOING LEFT PATTERNS. AFTER LIGHT ACFT COMPLETED HIS TOUCH AND GO ON RWY 01; HE WAS GIVEN CLRNC FOR ANOTHER PATTERN WITH A RIGHT TURN TO A RIGHT BASE; AND WE WERE CLRED FOR TKOF WITH THE COPLT MAKING THE TKOF. AS WE WERE PASSING 100 KTS I NOTICED THE LIGHT ACFT MAKING A LEFT TURN TOWARD THE DEP END OF OUR RWY AT AN ALT OF 400-500' AGL. AS WE WERE MOVING RAPIDLY AND I HAD CLR VIS CONTACT; I NOTIFIED THE F/O OF THE PROB; TOLD HIM TO CONTINUE AND MAKE A VERY SHALLOW CLBOUT. AS WE LIFTED OFF TWR NOTIFIED THE LIGHT ACFT OF THIS WRONG TURN AND VERIFIED THAT WE HAD VIS SEP. WE PASSED DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE OTHER ACFT BY ABOUT 200'. IF VIS CONTACT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED; A MIDAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGH PROBABILITY. FROM MY OBSERVATION POINT; ALL PARTIES WERE COMPLYING WITH STANDARD PROCS; UP TILL THE TIME THAT THE LIGHT ACFT TURNED TO A LEFT INSTEAD OF RIGHT BASE. I SUSPECT TRNING WAS GOING ON AND BEING A QUIET SUNDAY MORNING THE OTHER ACFT WAS USED TO LEFT TURNOUTS AND UNCONSCIOUSLY CONTINUED IN ITS ESTABLISHED ROUTINE. FORTUNATELY FOR US; IT WAS A CLEAR DAY AND WE SAW THE OTHER ACFT WITH PLENTY OF TIME TO SPARE. THERE IS ALSO A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT TWR'S CALL WOULD ALSO HAVE HELPED US IF WE HAD NOT NOTICED THE OTHER ACFT A FEW SECS EARLIER. THE KEY HERE WAS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. WE WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE OTHER ACFT WITH TWR; HOWEVER THE OTHER PARTY NOT ONLY MADE A WRONG TURN; BUT ALSO THE CLR FOR TKOF CALLS ON RWY 33 WHICH SHOULD HAVE WARNED HIM THAT TURNING THAT WAY AT 500' AGL WOULD BE A PROB.,sma plt did not compli instruct twr lcl ctlr .

86,3000,0,WHILE WORKING LCL CTL E (OWNING RWYS 22L AND 27); ACR X; AN LGT; WAS CLRED TO LAND RWY 22L TO HOLD SHORT OF RWY 27. ACR X ON SHORT FINAL ANNOUNCED HE HAD TO GO AROUND. I IMMEDIATELY TOLD LCL CTL W (OWNING RWY 22R) TO LEAVE HIS DEP; AN ACR HVY JET; ON RWY HDG. I THEN TOLD ACR TO TURN LEFT HDG 180 DEGS AND MAINTAIN 30 (I WOULD HAVE GONE LEFT TO 140 DEGS; BUT I WOULD HAVE GONE INTO FINAL VECTORS AIRSPACE). I THEN COORDINATED WITH DEP CTL TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT GAR; HDG AND ALT. LESS THAN 5 SECS LATER WHEN I SAW NO TARGETS A FACTOR ON BRITE RADAR I TURNED ACR X LEFT TO 140 DEGS TO MAINTAIN 30 AND CONTACT DEP ON 133.0. WITHIN 5 SECS ACR Y APPEARED; LESS THAN 1 MI AHEAD OF ACR X; CLBING TO 50. ON INITIAL CONTACT WITH ACR X; HE TOLD DEP HE HAD ACR Y IN SIGHT AND WAS MAINTAINING VIS SEP. BECAUSE OF ACR Y (A BOS DEP OFF RWY 22R) NOT TAGGING UP ON THE BRITE RADAR AND 2 SEPARATE CTLRS WORKING 2 RWYS SEPARATED BY LESS THAN 1500' (CONSIDERED 1 RWY); THESE NEW PROCS IMPLEMENTED AT BOS TWR IN 3/90 CHANGE FORM HAVING 1 LCL CTLR AND 1 LCL MONITOR TO 2 LCL CTLRS. THIS HAPPENING MADE THE NEW PROCS AT BOS TWR VERY UNSAFE. I THINK THESE NEW PROCS OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT A LOT CLOSER. AFTER 4 WKS OF IMPLEMENTATION; THEY ARE MAKING THINGS UNSAFE AND A LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR BOTH PLT AND CTLR. PLTS HAVE NUMEROUS FREQ CHANGES AND ARE NOT ON THE FREQ AT THE RWY HOLDING THINGS UP CAUSING DELAYS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: RPTR EXPERIENCE: 9 YRS NON-RADAR. RPTR STATED RADAR SEP HAD BEEN LOST PRIOR TO ACR X STATING THAT ACR Y WAS IN SIGHT. RPTR HAD COORDINATED WITH LCL CTL W (TRNING IN PROGRESS); BUT WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT ACR Y. TWR SUPVR INSTRUCTED RPTR TO TURN ACR X TO 140 DEG HDG FOR NOISE ABATEMENT. RPTR HAD COORDINATED 180 DEG HDG WITH DEP CTL. SPLIT LCL CTL POSITIONS ARE WORKING MUCH BETTER NOW AS CTLRS BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCS. RPTR WAS FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF TRNING PRIOR OT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPLIT POSITIONS; AND THE LACK OF SUPVR ASSISTANCE DURING THE SHAKE-OUT PHASE.

88,2000,5,I WAS WORKING LCL CTL W COMBINED WITH OUR LCL CTL HELI POS; AND ALSO WORKING ARRS TO OUR ACTIVE DEP RWY; BECAUSE OUR PARALLEL LNDG RWY WAS CLOSED. A TRACON SECTOR CALLED ME TO ADVISE CPR X A HELI WAS INBND FROM THE SW; AND ASKED ME IF THE HELI COULD MAKE IT IN VISUALLY. 'VIS APCH OR VFR?' I TOLD HIM THE HELI SHOULD MAKE IT IN VISUALLY. I THOUGHT THE HELI WAS INBND VFR. TRACON SOON HANDED OFF THE HELI BY ARTS (AT 2000') AND I ACCEPTED THE HDOF. I ISSUED A TCA CLRNC AND ASKED CPR X TO START A DSND; AND REITERATED IT WAS A VFR DSNT. HE SAID HE WAS UNABLE. I ASSUMED IT WAS FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES. (WE LATER FOUND OUT THERE WAS AN UNRPTED LAYER OF CLOUDS AT 1800'.) I CONTINUED TO DEPART FIXED WING ACFT OFF RWY 22R; ANTICIPATING CPR X WOULD DSND. I TURNED ACR Y 250 DEGS AND SENT HIM TO DEP FREQ; AGAIN ANTICIPATING THE CPR X WOULD DSND AND HAVE ACR Y IN SIGHT. CPR X SAID HE WOULD START A DSNT. I ISSUED IT; AND CPR X CAME RIGHT BACK AND SAID UNABLE AT THIS TIME. I THEN COORDINATED WITH THE DEP CTLR TO TURN ACR Y BACK TO 220 DEGS OR 180 DEGS TO PROVIDE LAT SEP. CPR X THEN SAID HE COULD DSND. I GAVE THE DSNT AND ISSUED ACR Y AS TFC; ASSUMING ACR Y WAS TURNING SBND AWAY FROM CPR X. (THE TAPES SHOWED THE DEP CTLR NEVER ISSUED ACR Y A TURN BACK TO 200 OR 180 DEGS.) CPR X SAID HE HAD ACR Y IN SIGHT AND I TOLD HIM TO MAINTAIN VIS SEP FROM IT. I THOUGHT CPR X WAS VFR AND DID NOT PROVIDE IFR SEP.

89,1700,5,I WAS IN THE TFC PATTERN SHOOTING TOUCH AND GOES AT DXR (TWR CTLED). ANOTHER SMA Y WAS ALSO IN CLOSED TFC. AFTER BEING CLRED FOR TOUCH AND GO ON THIRD OR FOURTH CIRCUIT; THINGS GOT BUSY. I RPTED DOWNWIND AND WAS TOLD I WAS #5 FOR LNDG. ACFT Y WAS FLYING A VERY WIDE PATTERN. (ON MY FIRST TKOF; SOME TIME AFTER CLOSE TFC HAD DONE A TOUCH AND GO; I WENT OUT APPROX 1/2 MI. AT 1200' TURNED XWIND AND LOOKED LEFT FOR THE SMA X ON DOWNWIND. I THOUGHT HE MUST BE FAR AHEAD OF ME. I TURNED DOWNWIND AND RPTED; AND THE SMA Y RPTED BEHIND ME. HE MUST HAVE EXTENDED UPWIND A LONG WAY. I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED OUT EVERY WINDOW; AND ASKED HIS POS.) I DIDN'T HAVE HIM OR ANOTHER SMA Z ALSO ON DOWNWIND IN SIGHT. I CONTINUED DOWNWIND MUCH FURTHER THAN I NORMALLY WOULD. ANOTHER PLANE ENTERED DOWNWIND BEHIND ME; AND THE TWR SAID TO THEM 'TFC IS AN SMT X AHEAD OF YOU; SHOULD BE TURNING BASE.' I WAS THAT SMA X. I WAS ABOUT 5 NM FROM THE ARPT ON DOWNWIND (ACCORDING TO LORAN); AND I ASSUMED I HAD MISSED SEEING THE PLANES AHEAD OF ME TURN BASE AND FINAL. I THOUGHT THAT THE TWR'S COMMENT WAS A HINT THAT I SHOULD ALREADY HAVE TURNED BASE; PARTICULARLY WHEN I NOTED THAT I WAS ALMOST OUT OF THE ATA. THE FREQ WAS BUSY AND SO RATHER THAN CALL AND ASK WHERE ALL MY TFC WAS; I FIGURED THEY MUST HAVE BOTH BEEN ON FINAL BY NOW. I TURNED BASE; STILL AT PATTERN ALT OF 1700'; AND A FEW SECS LATER NOTED THE SMA Z AT MY 7-8 O'CLOCK POS; A COUPLE OF HUNDRED FT ABOVE ME. HE WAS ON FINAL AND PASSED OVER ME. HE RADIOED THE TWR THAT ANOTHER SMA HAD PASSED UNDER HIM. THE TWR ASKED IF HE COULD FOLLOW ME IN. I SAID I WAS BEHIND HIM ON BASE AND COULD FOLLOW HIM IN. HE WAS CLRED TO LAND AND THEN HAD TO GO AROUND DUE TO AN ACFT ON THE RWY. I THEN LANDED. IN MY TRNING I WAS TAUGHT TO KEEP THE PATTERN WITHIN 1/2 MI FROM THE RWY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN PLANES FLY SUCH A VERY WIDE PATTERN BEFORE; AND I MUST HAVE BEEN LOOKING WHERE I EXPECTED THEM TO BE; RATHER THAN OUT TO THE RIGHT WHERE THEY MUST HAVE BEEN.

90,13000,37,WHILE WORKING AS THE RADAR CTLR I HAD ACR X (RTE BGR-SCUPP-BOS) IN A DSNT TO FL110. THE OTHER ACFT WAS MLT Y (RTE PSM-SCUPP-FLOUN POGGO LPLA) WAS CLBING TO FL230. WHEN CONFLICT ALERT ACTIVATED I ISSUED A XING RESTRICTION TO ACR X (40 E OF BUS AT FL110). CONFLICT ALERT DISCONTINUED. AS I MONITORED THE DSNT AND CLB OF BOTH ACFT I REALIZED THAT SEP WAS GOING TO BE LOST. I TOLD ACR X TO EXPEDITE TO FL150; ACR X RPTED OUT OF FL130 APPROX 6 MI E OF MLT Y. ALTHOUGH SEP WAS NOT LOST; I FAILED TO INSURE SEP BY USING A XING RESTRICTION THAT I ASSUMED WOULD HAVE ACR X BELOW MLT Y. I BELIEVE THE ACR X (TFC WAS OBSERVED) HAD TURNED HIS ACFT AS WELL AS DSNDED TO AVOID MLT Y. THE ACTION I TOOK INITIALLY WHEN CONFLICT ALERT ACTIVATED; I FEEL WAS CORRECT; HOWEVER; THE XING RESTRICTION USED WAS NO GOOD. OTHER TFC PREVENT THE USE OF VECTORS ON EITHER ACFT.

91,9000,25,WE WERE FLYING IFR AT 9000' SKIMMING THE TOPS (IN AND OUT). THERE WERE NUMEROUS SMALL CUMULUS BUILD-UPS PROTRUDING FROM THE CLOUD TOPS AND WE WERE DEVIATING GENTLY RIGHT AND LEFT TO GO AROUND THE ROUGHEST LOOKING ONES TO TRY TO KEEP THE RIDE AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE. THE ACFT WAS LOADED WITH THE CG WELL WITHIN LIMITS; BUT TOWARD THE AFT END OF THE RANGE. WITH THE SMT; THIS CAN LEAD TO AN ANNOYING TENDENCY FOR THE ACFT TO 'HUNT' A LITTLE BIT IN PITCH WHEN IN CHOPPY AIR. WE WERE HANDED OFF TO BDL APCH A FEW MI SE OF CANAN INTXN; AND I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF BEING GIVEN THE BDL ALTIMETER; SO I HAD ALB'S ALTIMETER SETTING ON THE CAPT'S ALTIMETER (WHICH DRIVES THE MODE C). A FEW MINS LATER WE HEARD BDL ISSUE A TFC ADVISORY TO A MIL FLT USING THE CALL SIGN OF THE FGT SQUADRON AT BDL; CALLING THEIR TFC AS; '...AN SMT; 500 BELOW YOU; LEVEL 9000; YOU'RE SLOWLY OVERTAKING.' APCH THEN CALLED OUR TFC; '...A FLT OF FGT'S IN YOUR 6 O'CLOCK; 9500'; 6 MI; SLOWLY OVERTAKING.' I REPLIED THAT WE COULDN'T SEE 'OUR 6;' BUT WOULD NOTIFY THE TAIL GUNNER. AT THIS POINT THE F/O AND I BOTH BEGAN MAKING FREQUENT GLANCES OVERHEAD. THE APCH CTLR AGAIN CALLED US AS TFC TO THE FGT'S WHEN THE RANGE WAS INSIDE 2 MI; AS THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING TROUBLE SEEING US. (WE COULD ONLY HEAR THE CTLR'S SIDE OF THAT CONVERSATION; AS THE FGT'S WERE ON UHF.) AFTER A SHORT PAUSE; THE CTLR; REPLYING TO AN UNHEARD XMISSION; SAID; 'THAT'S APPROVED;' AND AFTER A FEW SECS THE LEAD FGT CAME INTO SIGHT; BUT NOT 500' OVERHEAD AS EXPECTED; HE WAS MUCH HIGHER (1500 OR 2000'). EVENTUALLY THE WING MAN CAME INTO VIEW AND HE WAS HIGHER STILL AND 1/2-1 MI OFF TO OUR RIGHT. WE WERE SCANNING THE SKY FOR THE OTHER PAIR (THEY NORMALLY OPERATE IN FLTS OF 4). WHEN APCH SAID; 'FLT; CHK YOUR ALT; I SHOW YOU 200' HIGH; BDL ALTIMETER 29.88!'; I GLANCED DOWN AND SAW MY ALTIMETER SHOWING APPROX 9130'; AND THE OLD ALB ALTIMETER SETTING. MY F/O (PF) WAS SHOWING LESS THAN 9100' WITH THE SAME SETTING. I SET 29.88 AND TOLD THE F/O TO FLY MY ALTIMETER; THEN CONFESSED TO BDL THAT WE STILL HAD ALB'S ALTIMETER.

SINCE THE ACFT HAD NO MODE C; THE CTLR MANUALLY ENTERED THE ALT AS 6500'. I TURNED ACR X TO A 300 DEG HDG TO VECTOR HIM TOWARD PWL AND CLBED HIM TO 6000' TO PASS 500' BELOW THE VFR ACFT. AS ACR X PASSED THROUGH APPROX 5300' HE SAID HE HAD JUST MISSED THE OTHER ACFT. I ASKED THE CTLR NEXT TO ME TO VERIFY THE ALT OF THE VFR ACFT AND THE VFR ACFT HAD IN FACT DSNDED THROUGH 5500'; HOWEVER; THE OTHER CTLR HAD NOT MANUALLY CHANGED THE ALT ON THE SCOPE; SO IT STILL SHOWED 6500'.

DEP THEN CLRED US TO 10000' AND ZBW. THE EVASIVE ACTION WAS ABRUPT; BUT EVERYONE WAS SEATED AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. AFTER ARR IN ATL; A CONFERENCE CALL BTWN ME; FLT CTL AND ATC WAS HELD. ATC HAD DETERMINED THAT AN SMA Y WITH NO MODE C; ALT READOUT; HAD BEEN CLRED OUT OF 6500' TO 5500'; BUT THE CTLR HAD GOTTEN BUSY AND HAD FAILED TO CHANGE THE ALT TAG ON THE SCOPE. THEREFORE THE CTLR HANDLING MY FLT DID NOT KNOW OF THE ALT CHANGE OF SMA Y. THE ATC SUPVR ON THE PHONE WITH ME LISTENED TO SEVERAL PARTS OF THE TAPE DURING OUR CONVERSATION.

99,2600,20,WHILE FLYING AN ILS APCH TO RWY 35 AT MHT. THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. AS THE PNF AT THE TIME; I HAD JUST ACKNOWLEDGED APCH CTL'S INSTRUCTIONS TO DSND TO 3000' AND INTERCEPT LOC INBND. SINCE OUR PASS BRIEFING SYS WAS INTERMITTENT. I INFORMED THE F/O (PF) THAT I WOULD BE OFF THE FREQ. WHILE GIVING THE BRIEFING I HEARD THE F/O'S XMITTER CLICKING; WHICH MEANT HE WAS TALKING TO APCH CTL. DURING THIS TIME THE F/O HAD BEEN DSNDING FROM 4000' TO 3000'; BUT STOPPED AT 3300' THEN CLBED 3500' THEN CONTINUED DSNDING. AT THIS TIME WE WERE ESTABLISHED ON THE LOC AND G/S. WHEN I RETURNED TO THE FREQ WE WERE DSNDING THROUGH 2700' AND STILL ESTABLISHED ON THE ILS. TO ME IT SEEMED LOGICAL THAT WE HAD BEEN CLRED FOR THE APCH SINCE WE WERE ABOUT 3-4 MI FROM GRENI (FAF FAN MARKER THAT IS ABOUT 1.1 MI W OF THE VOR THAT WAS THE DME). NOT WILLING TO ASSUME ANYTHING; I TWICE ASKED THE F/O IF WE HAD BEEN CLRED FOR THE APCH HE ASSURED ME BOTH TIMES THAT WE HAD BEEN. AS WE WERE DSNDING THROUGH 2400' APCH CTL ASKED WHY WE WERE NOT AT OUR ASSIGNED ALT 3000'. WE REGAINED ALT TO 3000' PROMPTLY; WHICH GAVE US FULL DEFLECTION ON THE G/S. WE WERE THEN CLRED FOR THE APCH W/O INCIDENT. DURING THIS TIME I DID HEAR APCH CTL SPEAKING TO ANOTHER ACFT WHETHER WE WERE EVER IN CONFLICT WITH THIS ACFT I DO NOT KNOW. AFTER PARKING AT THE GATE I QUESTIONED MY F/O AS TO WHAT WAS SAID WHILE I WAS OFF THE FREQ. F/O INFORMED ME THAT APCH CTL HAD REQUESTED HE CLB BACK TO 3500' DUE TFC. THEY THEN GAVE INSTRUCTIONS AS FOLLOWS: 'DSND TO 3000' MAINTAIN 3000' UNTIL ESTABLISHED ON THE LOC CLRED FOR THE APCH.' WHETHER THIS WAS SAID I DO NOT KNOW. I HAVE TO TAKE THE WORD OF THE F/O UNTIL I HEARD THE APCH CTL TAPES. OBVIOUSLY BEING PIC IT IS MY JOB TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AT ALL TIMES. I UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT FACT. IN FAIRNESS TO THE F/O; HE HAD SHOWN GOOD JUDGEMENT AND FLYING ABILITY DURING THE DAY BEFORE THIS INCIDENT.

AT APPROX 1 MI FROM RWY END ACR X STILL HAD NOT STARTED HIS TURN AND ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT HIM WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BY BOTH THE LCL CTLR AND DEP CTLR. AT THIS POINT ACR Y WAS BROKEN OFF THE APCH BY APCH CTL. ACR X FINALLY ANSWERED A CALL ON THE TWR FREQ WHICH HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON AND TURNED TO THE 090 DEG HDG HE WAS GIVEN AND THEN CONTACT WAS LOST WITH HIM AGAIN FOR THE NEXT MINUTE. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS OCCURRENCE WAS THE OPP DIRECTION TFC. THIS WAS CAUSED BY A SINGLE RWY OPERATION AT BDL AND DUE TO THE WINDS WE WERE USING RWY 15; BUT DUE TO WX MOST ARRS NEEDED RWY 33 FOR THE ILS APCH. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY ACR X DIDN'T START HIS TURN.

106,6500,25,I WAS WORKING THE S RADAR POS AT PORTLAND; ME; TRACON. TFC WAS MDT-HVY WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE TFC BTWN ENE VOR AND THE PWM ARPT. SMA X 25-35 MI NW OF THE ARPT SWBND WAS BEING GIVEN ADVISORIES AT 6500'. ALMOST ALL MY ATTN WAS ON THE ACFT IN THE VICINITY OF THE ARPT AND I DID NOT NOTICE WHEN I LOST RADAR ON THE 6500' TFC. WHEN I DID GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW ALL MY TFC I OBSERVED A TARGET SQUAWKING 1200 AT 6500' SWBND IN JUST ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE SMA X WAS FLYING. ASSUMING THAT SMA X HAD CHANGED HIS BEACON CODE TO 1200 W/O NOTIFYING ME BECAUSE HE COULDN'T GET THROUGH ON THE FREQ (THIS HAPPENS SEVERAL TIMES A WK); AND BECAUSE IT WAS A VFR ACFT AND I WAS STILL VERY BUSY I DID NOT QUESTION THE NEW BEACON CODE. FINALLY; THE ACFT ASKED IF I WAS GOING TO HAND HIM OFF DID I DISCOVER THAT I HAD LOST RADAR ON SMA X THERE WAS A VFR ACFT AT THE SAME ALT IN THE SAME VICINITY. THIS ALSO HAPPENED TO BE IN AN AREA NEAR (BUT NOT IN) A SECTION OF AIRSPACE WHERE WE HAVE A PROB WITH RADAR COVERAGE DUE TO A WELL DOCUMENTED RADAR PROB AT PWM. (SOMEONE BUILT A HOTEL NEXT TO THE RADAR SITE). I ADVISED SMA X THAT RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST AND SUBSEQUENTLY REIDENTED HIM 1 MI FROM ACFT Y ON A CONVERGING COURSE. I ISSUED TFC; WHICH SMA X SAW IMMEDIATELY. I SEE TWO PROBS IN WHAT OCCURRED. I MADE THE 'BIG' MISTAKE BY ASSUMING THAT SMA X CHANGED TO A 1200 CODE. THE RADAR PROBS AT PWM ARE DEFINITELY MORE OF A PROB THAN THE FAA FLT CHK FIRST REVEALED. IN THIS INSTANCE; I LOST RADAR ON AN ACFT AT 6500' WHERE WE HAVE A MINIMUM VECTORING ALT OF 4000'.

HAD WE NOT STOPPED OUR CLB THERE IS VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT WE WOULD HAVE HIT. I ASKED THE CTLR WHY HE GAVE US BOTH A CLB. HIS ANSWER WAS THAT HE HAD ASKED MLG IF HE SAW WDB AND RECEIVING A YES ANSWER GAVE HIM A VIS CLB. I ASKED FOR CLRNC TO CONTINUE OUR CLB AND IT WAS GIVEN. I TOLD THE CTLR THAT HE WAS WRONG TO GIVE THAT KIND OF CLRNC; BECAUSE YOU CANNOT JUDGE DEPTH AT NIGHT. ATC APOLOGIZED AND SAID HE LEARNED SOMETHING. AT ABOUT 50 DEGS W I TALKED TO MLG ON 131.8. HE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE AT 11000' AND HOLDING BECAUSE; WHEN HE SAID THAT HE DID SEE WDB AND ASKED WHAT ALT WDB WAS AT; THE ANSWER WAS 11000'.

THE STRIPS INDICATED THAT THE ACFT EVENTUALLY INVOLVED; LTT BOS TO NY; SHOWED 8000' ON THE STRIP; AND SMT MVY TO EWR VIA HFD AT 10000'. AS A RESULT OF THE ATTN REQUIRED ON V16 (THE OPP SIDE OF THE RADAR SCOPE) AND THE VOL OF TFC; I HEARD SMT CHK IN; BUT DID NOT HEAR HIM ADVISE THAT HE WAS OUT OF 6000' FOR 8000'. THE STRIP STILL SHOWED 10000' AS THE FINAL. IT HAD BEEN AMENDED IN FDIO BY CAPT TRACON; HOWEVER; THEY DID NOT COORDINATE AS REQUIRED WHEN THE AMENDMENT IS MADE LESS THAN 15 MINS PRIOR TO HDOF. IN ADDITION THE FLT DATA PERSON WHO RECEIVED THE AMENDMENT VIA FDIO DID NOT AMEND THE STRIP. BASICALLY THE PROB OCCURRED BECAUSE I SAW 10000' ON THE STRIP AND DID NOT REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT THE PLT TOLD ME. THE OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTED IN THAT HAD THEY BEEN DONE THEY WOULD HAVE ALERTED ME TO THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT BUT THE FINAL SAFEGUARDS ARE MY EYES AND EARS AND MY MINDSET THAT SMT WAS CLBING TO 10000' BLINDED ME TO ALT READOUTS AND DEAFENED ME TO PLT'S COMMENTS AND RPTS.

118,13500,5,WHILE WORKING SECTOR 07 I WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT INVOLVING MLG X AND LGT Y. LOSS OF 5 MI OR 1000' OCCURRED.

119,38500,220,MISSION INVOLVED PROVIDING TARGET ACFT FOR TEST OF AIR SEARCH RADAR ON BOARD A VESSEL THAT HAD RECENTLY COMPLETED A MAJOR OVERHAUL. SHIP REQUIRED TARGET ACFT TO BE AT 40000'; FLY OVERHEAD AND PROCEED 225 NM SE; DO A 180 DEG TURN AND RETURN TO OVERHEAD. PIC REQUESTED AND RECEIVED AN IFR CLRNC FROM BOSTON CTR TO OPERATE AS REQUESTED IN A BLOCK ALT FROM FL390 TO FL410. AS FLT PROCEEDED OFFSHORE AT FL400; BOSTON CTR ADVISED THAT NEW YORK CTR WOULD REQUIRE FL410 DUE TO TFC. AFTER CONCURRENCE WITH SHIP RADAR OPERATOR THAT 1000' INCREASE WOULD NOT DEGRADE TESTS; PIC ACCEPTED FL410. BOSTON CTR THEN HANDED FLT OFF TO NEW YORK WITH COMS THROUGH COMMERCIAL RADIO ON 129.9. AS FLT APCHED DESIGNATED TURN POINT; I RECOGNIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH NEARLY FULL AVAILABLE PWR WAS BEING UTILIZED; INDICATED AIRSPD WAS DECREASING AT A VERY SLOW RATE. I ADVISED COPLT (PF) TO MAKE THE TURN AT A VERY SLOW RATE. AS I PREPARTED TO ASK FOR LOWER ALT AND MAKE A POS RPT; I BECAME SOMEWHAT DISTR AND CP SELECTED HDG MODE ON FLT DIRECTOR. THE AUTOPLT PLACED ACFT IN A 28 DEG BANK. AIRSPD DECREASED FURTHER AND AT AN ALARMING RATE. I DIRECTED CP TO LEVEL WINGS BUT PRE STALL BUFFET WAS FELT BY THE ENTIRE CREW. PF ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN FL410 BUT IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT A STALL WOULD SOON OCCUR. I THEN DIRECTED A SLOW DSNT AND ADVISED COMMERCIAL RADIO  OF PROB. NY CTR CAME UP ON COMMERCIAL RADIO FREQ AND ADVISED ME TO STAY AT FL410 DUE TO TFC. I ADVISED NY CTR THAT I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT DUE TO IMPENDING STALL. THE ACFT CONTINUED DSNT AT 500-1000 FT/MIN AND LEVELED OFF AT 38500' MSL. DURING DSNT; I TURNED ON ALL LNDG LIGHTS AND DIRECTED ALL CREW MEMBERS TO MAINTAIN INCREASED WATCH FOR TFC. NONE WAS SIGHTED DESPITE UNLIMITED VISIBILITY. NY CTR ADVISED LAT/LONG POS OF TWO CONFLICTING HVY JETS AT FL370 AND 390 RESPECTIVELY THEN DIRECTED US TO MAINTAIN FL380. THIS ALLOWED US TO INCREASE AIRSPD AS WE WERE HANDED OFF TO BOSTON CTR. BOSTON THEN ASSIGNED FL390 FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT. I WAS CLRLY IN ERROR BY ACCEPTING FL410. ONCE AT THAT ALT; I REALIZED THAT THE ACFT WAS TOO HVY AND THAT AIRSPD WAS SLOWLY DECREASING BUT FAILED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION. I ALSO FAILED TO LISTEN TO AN UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVEN HINT GIVEN BY MY COPLT; WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE INCIDENT; WHEN AT 160 KTS IAS AND 335 KTS TAS HE ASKED; 'I WONDER WHAT STALL SP IS?' I THOUGHT THAT I COULD GENTLY TURN BACK TOWARD THE SHIP; BE HANDED OFF TO BOSTON; RE-ESTABLISH RADAR CONTACT AND DSND BEFORE THE SITUATION GOT 'OUT OF CTL'. CLRLY; I ALLOWED MY DESIRES TO ACCOMPLISH THE RADAR TESTS TO OVERSHADOW GOOD COMMON SENSE. WHO WAS I ALLOWING TO BE THE PIC? THE SHIPS RADAR OPERATOR? THE MY CTLR? I SHOULD HAVE MONITORED THE CP'S ACTIONS MORE CLOSELY ALTHOUGH I IN NO WAY BLAME HIM FOR THE PROBS.

120,9900,28,I AM AN AIR TFC CTLR. ON THE ABOVE DATE I WAS ON A FAMILIARIZATION FLT ON THE MLG; WHICH WAS TCAS EQUIPPED. IN LEVEL FLT AT 11000' ON THE ROCKDALE 5 ARR; TCAS ISSUED; 'TFC.' TFC WAS DEPICTED ON TCAS AT 12 O'CLOCK AND 6 MI; 1100' BELOW OUR ALT. AT 3 MI TCAS ISSUED THE SAME TFC WARNING. AT 1 MI THE TCAS ISSUED A CONFLICT RESOLUTION TO THIS TFC THAT WAS TELLING THE PLT TO DSND. THE TCAS DISPLAY SHOWED THE TFC STILL 1100' BELOW OUR ALT. THE CAPT STATED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAD RECEIVED A BAD CONFLICT RESOLUTION FROM TCAS. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: RPTR PROVIDED TYPES ACFT INVOLVED; AND SAID THAT THE ACFT AT 10000' WAS ON V299; NOT LNDG AT BDL. RPTR CALLED TRACON AFTER LNDG AND GOT MORE INFO FROM APCH CTLR. TFC WAS NOT ISSUED TO THE MLG SINCE THERE WAS 1000' SEP AND CTLR WAS BUSY WITH OTHER ACFT. TFC WAS ISSUED TO THE SMA. RPTR DID NOT SEE OTHER ACFT DUE TO CLOUDS INCIDENT OCCURRED ABOUT 25 MI FROM VOR. ALT OF OTHER ACFT SHOWED UP ON TCAS AS '-10;' '-11;' AND '-12.' PLT HAD OTHER FALSE ALARMS WITH TCAS AND DID NOT COMPLY WITH TCAS ADVISORY AS COMPANY POLICIES MANDATES. RPTR THINKS THAT THE FLT STRIP SHOULD INDICATE WHETHER AN ACFT IS TCAS EQUIPPED OR NOT TO ALERT THE CTLR. RPTR ALSO STATES THAT CTLRS ARE CONFUSED WHEN PLTS OF TCAS EQUIPPED ACFT RPT TFC IN SIGHT. IN ONE INCIDENT; RPTR ISSUED TFC TO AN ACR AND PLT RPTED TFC IN SIGHT. RPT THOUGHT PLT MEANT VISUALLY; BUT PLT ONLY SAW ACFT ON TCAS SCOPE.

I TOOK IMMEDIATE EVASIVE ACTION BY GRABBING THE YOKE; DIVING AND TURNING RIGHT (NOW HIS FUSELAGE WAS DIRECTLY OVER OUR NOSE). TRNEE; SENSING SOMETHING WAS WRONG; THREW OFF HIS GOGGLES IN TIME TO SEE THE DIRTY; OILY BELLY AND THE WHEELS DOWN OF THE OTHER ACFT. ALL HE HEARD FROM ME WAS; 'OHHH.' NORMAL COCKPIT MGMNT PROC IS FOR ME TO SAY; 'I HAVE THE CTLS;' AND HIM TO RESPOND; 'YOU HAVE THE CTLS.' TWR AT NOT TIME CALLED EITHER ACFT Z OR X TFC.

I CALLED THE TWR ON LAND-LINE DIRECTLY AFTER LNDG AND THEN DROVE TO WHERE THE TWR SAID HE HAD PARKED. NO SIGN OF LIFE AT THE ACFT. 20 MINS AT MOST; HE PARKED POSTFLTED; TIED DOWN AND GOT THE HELL OUT. UNFORTUNATELY; THE TWR CHIEF WAS UNABLE TO REACH ME WITHIN 2 HRS AND HAD TO RPT TO HOTLINE. WILL REMEDIAL TRNING HELP THE OTHER PLT IF HE HAS A GOOD ATTITUDE (WHICH HE DID NOT DEMONSTRATE)? HAD THE TWR CALLED OUT TFC; THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.

130,8000,22,I WAS WORKING THE PWL RADAR POS AT BOSTON ARTCC. I OBSERVED NY TRACON LIBERTY E SECTOR HANDING OFF COMMUTER X TO ME AT 8000 FT NBOUND ON V487.

I THEN INSTRUCTED THE PWL RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR TO CALL THE DANBURY SECTOR AND TELL HIM TO STOP ACFT Y'S DSCNT AT 9000 FT. CORP Y THEN PASSED OVER THE TOP AND WITHIN A MI LATERALLY OF ACFT X. THE LIBERTY E CTLR HAD APPROVED A POINTOUT FROM THE DANBURY SECTOR TO DSND CORP Y TO 8000 FT. POOR CTL ABILITY BY THE LIBERTY E CTLR WAS THE DIRECT REASON THAT THE SITUATION OCCURRED. POOR PROCEDURES CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT. THESE ACFT (ACFT Y LNDG POU) SHOULD NOT BE ROUTED THROUGH THE DANBURY AND PAWLING SECTORS. BOSTON CENTER SHOULD NOT CTL ACFT LNDG IN NY TRACON AIRSPACE THAT DEPART ARPTS S OF NY TRACON AIRSPACE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: TRIED TO GET RPTR (ZBW CTLR) TO EXPLAIN THE AIRSPACE JURISDICTION IN DANBURY; PAWLING; POU AREA.

WE THEN PASSED THROUGH THE LOC ON PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED HDG (ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT STATE IT VERBALLY; WE BOTH ASSUMED THAT THE CTLR WAS HAVING US FLY THROUGH THE LOC FOR ADDITIONAL SPACING ON ACR Z WHICH WE ALSO ASSUMED THAT WE WERE FOLLOWING). APPROX 45 SECONDS AFTER FLYING THROUGH THE LOC OF 350 DEG HDG ATC ASKED US IF WE WERE INTERCEPTING THE LOC. I REPLIED 'NO SIR'.

APCH AND LNDG FROM THAT POINT WERE UNEVENTFUL. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1) VERY HIGH ATC WORKLOAD.

I DID NOT TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE PLANE WAS. WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECONDS I SAW A CPR PLANE DSNDING FROM BEHIND ME AND TO MY R AND I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION TO THE L. MY BEACON AND STROBES WERE ON AT THE TIME. I AM NOT SURE WHY THE CPR DID NOT SEE ME. I DID NOT HEAR THE TWR TALK TO HIM AFTER I CONTACTED THEM ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE. THE TWR DID NOT WARN ME OF HIM AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE WARNED HIM OF ME; BUT BECAUSE OF THE RECENT CHANGE OF FREQS I CAN'T BE SURE OF THAT.

I'M NOT SURE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO AVOID THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS SAID TO THE OTHER PLANE. BUT IF HE CAME FROM BEHIND ME AND SINCE HE WAS MUCH FASTER THAN ME I THINK APCH SHOULD HAVE WARNED HIM OF MY PRESENCE BEFORE HANDING HIM OFF TO THE TWR.

WE HAD DEPARTED OCEAN ARSA AND WERE ADVISED THAT A HDOF TO BOSTON APCH COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BUT WERE ADVISED TO CONTACT BOSTON APCH DIRECTLY. WE DID THIS AND HAD INITIAL DIFFICULTY WITH OUR #1 RADIO REACHING BOSTON AND COULD NOT EASILY UNDERSTAND THE SQUAWK CODE. WE WERE ADVISED THAT OUR TRANSPONDER WAS NOT WORKING AND NOT TO ENTER THE BOSTON TCA.

145,10000,25,ACR X INITIATED A CLB OF 300 FT AS A RESULT OF A TCASII ADVISORY AND/OR RA. THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE KNEW ABOUT SMT X FOR AT LEAST 10 MI; HE KNEW THE TFC WAS RESTR BELOW HIM; AND HE KNEW SMT Y HAD HIM IN SIGHT. (I HAD RESTR SMT Y AND WAS TALKING TO THEM BOTH.) IN SPITE OF THE INFO; HE WENT AHEAD AND COMPLIED WITH THE ADVISORY. MY CONCERN IS THAT UNDER SOME CONDITIONS; I; AS A CTLR; WOULD USE MIN SEPARATION TO EXPEDITE TFC OR TO EFFECT A SMOOTH ORDERLY FLOW. IF TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT ARE GOING TO DEVIATE EVEN IF THEY KNOW THE TFC IS GOING TO BE KEPT OUT OF THEIR WAY THEN IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICT; ESPECIALLY IN THE TERMINAL ENVIRONMENT. ANOTHER TCASII SITUATION OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WHEN A TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT DID NOT WANT TO TAKE A TURN TO THE R BECAUSE HE SAW A TARGET ON TCASII BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ALT ENCODER. THERE WAS NOT ANYBODY ON MY RADAR WITHIN 7 MI OF HIM; AND THE HDG THAT I WANTED HIM TO FLY DID NOT PUT HIM IN CONFLICT WITH ANYBODY. HIS SECOND GUESSING CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT THERE WASN'T ANY TFC TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. BY THE TIME ALL WAS SAID AND DONE; I WAS BEHIND WITH THE REST OF MY TFC. NOT A GOOD SITUATION.

147,6000,20,THE FOLLOWING TCAS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE FLT INTO BDL ARPT IN AN MLG ACFT ON WHICH I WAS SERVING AS FO. WX CONDITIONS WERE VMC IN TYPICAL SUMMER HAZE RESULTING IN REDUCED VISIBILITY. WE WERE ON A VECTOR TO A L DOWNWIND LEG; ABOUT 20 MI FROM THE ARPT; AND HAD BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH ONCE THE ARPT WAS IN SIGHT. DSNDING THROUGH ABOUT 7000 FT ON A CLRNC TO 6000 (CLEAN CONFIGN; 250 KTS IAS; AUTOPLT AND AUTOTHROTTLES ENGAGED; I WAS FLYING); WE RECEIVED A TFC ADVISORY FROM THE APCH CTLR CONCERNING AN ACFT AT OUR 11 O'CLOCK POS. THE TFC WAS DESCRIBED NOT BY ITS TYPE; BUT BY ITS OPERATOR'S NAME; A NAME NEITHER OF US RECOGNIZED. THE CAPT OF OUR ACFT SAW TFC 'A' THAT POS WHICH HE TOOK TO BE THE ACFT IN QUESTION AND HE ADVISED THE CTLR ACCORDINGLY. WHILE I DID NOT SEE THE TFC; THE CAPT ADVISED ME THAT AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED ON ITS PRESENT HDG; IT WOULD NOT BE A FACTOR FOR US. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE TCAS ADVISED 'TFC TFC' AND DISPLAYED A YELLOW CIRCLE AT OUR 11 O'CLOCK POS. THE TCAS WAS ON THE 40 MI RANGE AND DISPLAYED A LARGE NUMBER OF TARGETS (WELL IN EXCESS OF TEN). THE YELLOW TARGET; ON THIS RANGE; APPEARED VERY CLOSE TO OUR POS ON THE DISPLAY; SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO BE LOST IN CLUTTER OF OTHER ACFT AND ESSENTIALLY UNINTERPRETABLE; SO I SELECTED THE 5 MI RANGE FOR A MEANINGFUL LOOK. I ANTICIPATED THAT THE TARGET WOULD BE THE NON-CONFLICTING TFC WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED OUT AND SEEN BY THE CAPT. THE CAPT CONTINUED LOOKING OUT THE WINDSHIELD FOR THE TFC. BEFORE THE SHORTER RANGE DISPLAY COULD BE FULLY PAINTED AND INTERPRETED; THE TCAS GAVE US A 'CLB CLB CLB' ADVISORY AND THE PERIMETER LIGHTS ON THE VSI INDICATOR DISPLAYED RED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE INST THROUGH ZERO AND UP TO SOME HIGH POSITIVE VERT CLB RATE; WHERE SEVERAL GREEN LIGHTS WERE DISPLAYED. MY EARLIER EXPECTATION THAT NO HAZARD EXISTED APPEARED NOW TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT AND I RESPONDED BY ROLLING THE AUTOPLT'S VERT SPD THUMB WHEEL UP TO A HIGH RATE OF CLB. THE AUTOPLT'S SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM A 1000 FPM DSCNT TO A COMMANDED CLB IN EXCESS OF 2000 FPM WAS APPARENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE SITUATION SINCE; IN THE MIDST OF THAT VERT SPD TRANSITION; THE TCAS ADVISED 'INCREASE CLB INCREASE CLB'. I DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND HAND FLEW THE ACFT TO A HIGHER NOSE ATTITUDE. DURING THIS MANEUVER (WHICH CREATED A SLIGHT BUMP FOR THE PAXS SINCE THE PITCH TRIM HAD NOT QUITE KEPT UP WITH THE PITCH INCREASE); I SAW AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION MEDIUM SIZED TWIN PASS OFF TO OUR L SIDE AND SLIGHTLY BELOW US. I WOULD JUDGE THAT SEPARATION WAS LESS THAN HALF A MILE... PERHAPS A QUARTER OF A MI. AS IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BEHIND US; THE TCAS ADVISED 'CLR OF CONFLICT'. I GENTLY TRANSITIONED FROM A HIGH CLB RATE TO A COMFORTABLE DSCNT AND RETURNED TO THE 6000 FT ALT TO WHICH WE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY CLRED. THE CAPT ADVISED THE APCH CTLR OF THE INCIDENT AND THE CTLR REAFFIRMED THAT WE WERE CLRED TO RETURN TO 6000 FT. UPON SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CTLR; WE LEARNED THAT THE INTRUDING ACFT WAS A COMMUTER AND HAD BEEN THE TFC ORIGINALLY CALLED OUT TO US.

155,2500,3,ON SEP/SAT/91 AT XA05 A.M.; I WAS FLYING VFR AT 2500 MSL (APPROX 2000 FT AGL) FROM GREAT BEMINTON (GBR) TO FISHERS ISLAND; NY (0B8). NAV WAS LORAN DIRECT AND I HAD JUST PASSED ABOUT 3 MI NE OF THE HARTFORD VORTAC (HFD). I WAS ON FLT FOLLOWING WITH BRADLEY APCH (BDL) FREQ 125.8 SQUAWKING 5250. BRADLEY APCH WAS FAIRLY BUSY BUT HAD ALERTED ME TO OTHER TFC. BRADLEY APCH HAD JUST ASKED ME TO CHANGE TO A NEW SECTOR FREQ (I BELIEVE IT WAS 111.05). MY HDG WAS ABOUT 150 DEG. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO DIAL IN THE NEW FREQ WHEN I NOTICED A WHITE TWIN (SMT CLASS) NO MORE THAN 1/3-1/2 MI AWAY COMING STRAIGHT AT ME WITH A HDG OF ABOUT 270 DEG AT MY EXACT ALT. I TOOK IMMEDIATE EVASIVE ACTION TURNING SHARPLY TO THE R. THE PLANE PASSED APPROX 150 FT BEHIND ME TAKING NO EVASIVE ACTION. I COULD NOT GET N NUMBER. I CALLED BRADLEY ON THE CURRENT FREQ (125.8) AND ASKED IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING. THE CTLR SAID 'NO'. I THEN SWITCHED OVER TO THE NEW SECTOR AND ASKED IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING. AGAIN; 'NO'. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! THAT WAS A LARGE TARGET WELL WITHIN RADAR COVERAGE -- AT LEAST A PRIMARY ECHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE EVEN IF THE PLT DID NOT HAVE TRANSPONDER ON. I THINK THE CTLRS DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT THEIR FAILURE TO NOTICE A NMAC. THEY HAD CALLED NO TFC AT THE TIME. LESSON: 1) ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN; EVEN ON FLT FOLLOWING. 2) ESPECIALLY WATCH AT SECTOR CORNERS. 3) SOME PLTS MAY BE FLYING ILLEGALLY WITH TRANSPONDER OFF. 4) I AM FILING A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE CTLRS.,nmac .

FOR SEQUENCING BEHIND AN ACR MLG WHICH WAS W OF THE ARPT (AT 3000 FT). BOTH CREW LOOKING FOR VISUAL SIGHTING TO THE MLG WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN OUR 9-11 O'CLOCK POS. I MADE A VISUAL SCAN TO MY R AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE AN SMA AT MY 2 O'CLOCK POS APPROX 1/4 MI AWAY ON AN APPARENT COLLISION COURSE. HIS COURSE WAS APPROX DUE W. THE SMA WAS EXACTLY AT MY ALT OF 4000 FT. I CALLED THE TFC TO MY COPLT AND SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SMA COULD BE A PROBLEM. AFTER APPROX 2 SECONDS OF OBSERVATION OF THE SMA I DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO RELATIVE MOVEMENT OF THE SMA IN OUR WINDSCREEN AND THAT OUR 2 ACFT WERE ON A COLLISION COURSE. I TOLD MY COPLT TO TELL APCH CTL WE WERE TAKING EVASIVE ACTION; AND I INITIATED A RAPID DSCNT TO PASS BELOW THE SMA. APPARENTLY THE XMISSION TO APCH CTL WAS BLOCKED MOMENTARILY BY OTHER RADIO TFC. DURING THE NEXT BREAK IN CHATTER; THE CTLR CALLED US AND TOLD US TO MAINTAIN 4000 FT; POSSIBLY SHE HAD SEEN OUR TARGET DEVIATE FROM OUR ASSIGNED ALT. WE THEN INFORMED HER THAT WE HAD TAKEN EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID A MIDAIR COLLISION. SHE INFORMED US THAT SHE HAD NOT OBSERVED ANY OTHER TFC AND COMMENTED THAT THE UNKNOWN ACFT WAS PROBABLY NOT TRANSPONDER EQUIPPED. OUR ACFT WENT MOMENTARILY TO 3750 FT MSL FOR LESS THAN 10 SECONDS WHILE THE SMA PASSED OVERHEAD AND SLIGHTLY AFT. WE THEN CLBED BACK TO OUR ASSIGNED ALT.

THIS ARPT IS VERY BUSY DURING SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS. AN SMA A ON FINAL TO RWY 4 TRIED TO REACH THE LTT ON UNICOM. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THIS CALL; I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THE LTT WAS IN THE AREA. BASED ON THE CALL FROM THE SMA A TO THIS LTT I STARTED A DSCNT. THE LTT TRANSITED THE AREA AT 1500-2000 AGL WITHOUT EVEN TALKING ON UNICOM. AT THE TIME THEY WERE 3 SMAS; A GLIDER; AND AN LTT B ALL WITHIN 5 MI OF THE ARPT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PUBLISHED RECOMMENDATION FOR FLT AROUND BAR HARBOR/ARCADIA NATL PARK. AT THE TIME I WAS COMPLETING A SCENIC FLT AROUND THE ISLAND WITH 3 PAX. I HAD ON BOTH ROTATING BEACON STROBES AND LNDG LIGHTS. FOR THE PAST 50 YRS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FLYING AROUND THE ISLAND IN A CLOCKWISE MANNER AND THIS HAS BECOME ACCEPTED PRACTICE IN THE AREA. BOTH THE LTT AND AN SMA C FLEW AROUND THE ISLAND IN A COUNTER CLOCKWISE MANNER THAT DAY. I MET THE SMA C ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ISLAND EARLIER IN THE DAY (100 FT VERT 300 HORIZ). NEAR MISS. THE SMA C WAS MONITORING UNICOM AT THE TIME AND I INFORMED HIM OF THE ACCEPTED PRACTICE OF FLYING CLOCKWISE AROUND THE ISLAND AT THAT TIME.

161,6700,15,DURING DSCNT TO BDL IN CEILING AND VISIBILITY UNLIMITED; TCASII WAS ON AND IN RA/TA MODE. PASSING 9000 FT. ATC ADVISED TFC AT 11 O'CLOCK; 7 MI; NBOUND AT 6400 FT; UNCONFIRMED. NEXT CALL ATC: TFC 10:30; 3 MI; EBOUND. I EXTENDED THE WINGTIP LNDG LIGHTS AND CONTINUED VISUAL SCAN. I ALSO DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT TO ENABLE EVASIVE ACTION IF WARRANTED. NEXT: TCASII ANNUNCIATED TFC AT 10:30 AND -1100 FT. STILL UNABLE TO FIND THE TFC. ANOTHER ATC ADVISEMENT OF TFC AS WE PASSED THROUGH 7000 FT. I ASSUMED WE HAD CLRED THE TFC (TFC BEHIND US). AS WE HAD NO CONTACT/VISUAL SIGHTING AND THE CONFLICTING ACFT WAS CLOSE TO OUR ALT IN CLR AIR. AS WE CONTINUED THROUGH 6700 FT A TCASII RESOLUTION WAS TRIGGERED. TCASII ADVISED; 'CLB; CLB' AND INDICATED 1500 FPM CLB WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED. AS WE REACHED 7000 FT LEVEL OFF WAS INDICATED. FLT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY TO BDL. CONCLUSIONS AND ANALYSIS: I BELIEVE THAT BDL TRACON MISJUDGED OUR VERT AND HORIZ FLT PATH. HIS EXPECTATION WAS THAT WE WOULD HAVE PASSED OVERHEAD THE TFC WHICH WAS AT AN UNCONFIRMED ALT. HE RELIED ON THIS TO ACHIEVE SEPARATION. NO VECTORS WERE GIVEN TO ASSURE HORIZ SEPARATION. I RELIED ON VISUALLY SIGHTING THE TFC THE WX WAS SO GOOD. AS A RESULT I DID NOT REQUEST A HDG TO ASSURE SEPARATION. I RELIED ON BDL TO PROVIDE HORIZ SEPARATION IN THE EVENT VISUAL SIGHTING WAS NOT ACHIEVED. MY NORMAL DSCNT PROFILE IS 240 KTS IAS/2200-2500 FPM. DURING DISCUSSION OF THE EVENT WITH BDL TRACON THE CTLR STATED OUR GND SPD WAS 270 KTS. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE ACFT WAS TRIMMED SLIGHTLY NOSE DOWN AND AS I BECAME INTENT ON THE TFC I ALLOWED THE SPD TO BUILD UP (ALTHOUGH I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE 270 KTS). I MAY HAVE PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE VISUAL SCAN AREA. THIS WOULD HAVE CREATED A RAPID DSCNT WHICH ELIMINATED THE REQUIRED VERT SEPARATION. CONCLUSION: IN THE FUTURE I WILL ALLOW OR ACCEPT ONLY HORIZ SEPARATION WITH VFR/IFR TFC AT UNCONFIRMED ALTS. IF NOT OFFERED; I WILL REQUEST THE SEPARATION. WITH THE INFO THE CTLR HAS ON THE TRACON DISPLAY; HE WAS IN A POS TO HAVE OFFERED A POSITIVE RESOLUTION WELL BEFORE THE SITUATION BECAME CRITICAL.

163,15000,15,I WAS TRAINING A PERSON IN THE RADAR POS AT BOSOX SECTOR IN AREA C IN BOSTON CENTER. WE HAD A FULL PERFORMANCE RADAR ASSOCIATE IN OUR D-SIDE. 30 MINS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT; TFC WAS MODERATE WHICH THE RADAR TRAINEE WAS HANDLING SATISFACTORILY. (8-15 ACFT).

TFC HAD BUILT IN THE HFD VICINITY WHICH THE RADAR TRAINEE WAS SATISFACTORILY HANDLING. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM CTR SECTOR ON A POINT OUT ON AN ACR ORH DEP CLBING TO 160 DIRECT CTR. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE APPROVED THE POINT OUT. I TURNED TO THE RADAR ASSOCIATE AND SAID CALL THEM BACK AND TELL THEM UNABLE DUE TO TFC IN VICINITY AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE CTR SECTOR HAD A POINT OUT ON CPR Y AT 150; THE GET CTL REF ACR X AND OTHER ACR. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE COMPLETED THE CALL AND SAID 'IT'S ALL SET; CTR IS WATCHING CPR Y.' THE RADAR TRAINEE THEN TURNED CPR Y 30 DEGS R TO INITIATE CLB ONCE ACR X AT 160 WAS CLR.

169,5700,18,WHILE CRUISING AND IN CONTACT WITH AND UNDER CTL OF BOSTON APCH I SAW A LARGE AIRLINE JET AT 10 O'CLOCK POS; CONVERGING PATH; WITHIN 1 MI. HE SEEMED TO BE AT MY ALT. ATC DID NOT RPT TFC TO ME; NOR DID I HEAR MY POS RPTED TO THE HVY. AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE HIS ALT; I DECIDED I COULD DELAY NO LONGER. I KNEW THAT IF I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION NOW; I WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO CLR THE TFC. I TOOK CTLS FROM THE PF; TURNED 45 DEG TO MY R AND DSNDED QUICKLY TO APPROX 5700 FT WHEN I SAW THE JET BEHIND ME AND WELL ABOVE. I THEN RETURNED TO 6500 FT AND ON COURSE AND BEFORE I COULD INFORM ATC OF MY EVASIVE ACTION I WAS QUERIED BY ATC. ATC THEN TOLD ME THE JET WAS LEVEL AT 6000 AND THAT MY EVASIVE ACTION BROUGHT ME CLOSER TO HIS ALT. THE PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED BY ADHERENCE TO THE SEE AND AVOID CONCEPT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ATC'S FAILURE TO INFORM ME OF CONVERGING PATH TFC. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS 500 FT VERT SEPARATION IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM THE JET WAS BELOW ME; AND NOT CLBING. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: PERCEPTIONS: 500 FT SEPARATION IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WITH CONFIDENCE NECESSARY TO ENSURE COLLISION AVOIDANCE. JUDGEMENTS: I JUDGED THE JET TO BE EITHER AT MY ALT; OR CLBING SINCE IT JUST DEPARTED BOSTON (OR IT APPEARED TO BE DEPARTING BOSTON). DECISIONS: I HAD NO TIME TO FURTHER ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE ALT CONVERGENCE NOR TO QUERY ATC ABOUT THE AIRLINER. SO I DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION THAT SHOULD ENSURE AVOIDANCE; RATHER THAN GAMBLE THAT THE JET WAS LOWER THAN ME. ACTIONS/INACTIONS: IF I WAS INFORMED BY ATC AS TO THE JET'S ALT; I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR SEPARATION; AND MAYBE EVASIVE ACTION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY. THE LACK OF A TA IN SUCH A TIGHT SITUATION LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT MAYBE SOMETHING WAS AWRY WITH ATC.,flt instr spi ha close encount jet . take evas action . cruis IN contact under ctl OF boston apch I saw A larg airlin jet AT 10 o'clock po ; converg path ; within 1 MI .

SO I decid TO take action that should ensur avoid ; rather gambl that jet wa lower ME . actions/inact : IF I wa inform BY atc AS TO jet 'S alt ; I would have been more confid about separ ; mayb evas action would not have been necessari . lack OF A TA IN such A tight situat led ME TO believ that mayb someth wa awri atc . ,FLT INSTR WITH SPI HAS CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH JET.

WE CALLED THAT TFC IN SIGHT AND WERE CLRED TO 'REF THAT TFC CLB TO 17000.' I WATCHED THE TFC AND NOTIFIED THE CAPT THAT IT WAS 'CONSTANT BEARING; DECREASING RANGE.' HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT AND TOLD THE FO TO INCREASE THE RATE OF CLB. THE FO INCREASED THE RATE OF CLB. ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER THE TFC APPEARED MUCH CLOSER THAN IT DID WHEN WE HAD FIRST SIGHTED IT. WE WERE AT 10900 FT AND THE CAPT INSTRUCTED THE FO TO PUSH IT OVER. THE FO PERFORMED A MILD PUSH OVER. CLB RATE DECREASED FROM APPROX 2000-1000 FPM. THE ACFT CONTINUED TO CLB AND THE CAPT SHOUTED 'LEVEL OFF' AND PUSHED FORWARD ON THE CTL COLUMN. WE LEVELED AT 11250 JUST AS THE COMMUTER PLANE PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. WHAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. WE SAW THE ACFT AND ASSUMED THAT IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY FAR AWAY DUE TO ITS RELATIVE SIZE IN THE WINDSCREEN. IT WAS ACTUALLY MUCH CLOSER THAN WE THOUGHT BECAUSE IT WAS A TWIN ENG COMMUTER PLANE. THE CAPT DID NOT TAKE ADEQUATE ACTION TO COM TO THE FO HIS DESIRE FOR HIM TO LEVEL THE ACFT AT 11000 FT. THIS WAS WAY TOO CLOSE. IT DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE BEEN A MID AIR COLLISION.

172,13000,20,ACR X ON SWF ARR IS RTED VIA BDR V91 STUBY V205 TRESA SWF. THESE ACFT HAVE TO BE DSNDED INTO N90'S AIRSPACE IN ORDER TO MEET A XING RESTRICTION AT 60 FOR ANOTHER N90 SECTOR. BUT THE FIRST N90 SECTOR (LIBERTY E) WILL NOT WORK THE ACFT BUT WILL ACCEPT POINTOUTS ON THE ACFT DSNDING UP TO 1000 FT INTO THEIR AIRSPACE. WE GET THE ACFT FROM ZNY AT THE LOWEST VISIBLE FL (FL190 IN THIS INSTANCE). LIBERTY E APPROVED A POINTOUT ON ACR X DSND TO 140 ONLY. THEY THEN CALLED BACK ISSUING TFC FOR ACR X WHICH WAS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ACR X CLBING TO 17000. WE AGREED TO TURN OUR TFC TO THE NW AND DSND ACR X UNDERNEATH THEIR TFC WHICH THEY STOPPED AT 160. I STOPPED ACR X AT 17000 AND TURNED TO A 310 DEG HDG. WHEN I HAD ACHIEVED LATERAL SEPARATION; ISSUED A DSCNT TO ACR X TO 14000. LIBERTY E THEN CALLED US AND SAID WE COULD GO TO 12000 WITH ACR X. I ISSUED DSCNT TO 120 ON ACR X AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER; OBSERVED A CONFLICT ALERT WITH ACR Y WHO SHOWED AN ALT OF V128 IN DATA BLOCK. I ASSUMED ACR Y WAS VFR AND THAT ACR X WOULD BE SAFELY IN FRONT OF TFC BEFORE THEIR ALTS WERE CLOSE. WE THEN FOUND OUT ACR Y WAS IFR EVEN THOUGH OUR COMPUTER HAD NO FLT PLAN. I COULD NOT STOP THE DSCNT OF ACR X IN TIME AND SEPARATION WAS LOST (3.6 NM). SINCE BOTH ACFT WERE IN N90'S AIRSPACE; I WAS TOLD THAT NO OPERROR EXISTED SINCE THEY ONLY NEED 3 NM SEPARATION. BUT N90 HAD NO IDEA WHAT HDG I HAD ISSUED ACR X; AS I ONLY TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD GO NW (WHICH WAS TOWARD ACR Y) TO GO UNDER THE TFC THEY HAD ISSUED TO US ON THE POINTOUT. IN MY OPINION; IT WAS ONLY BLIND LUCK THAT PREVENTED ACR X FROM COMING WITHIN 3 NM OF ACR Y AND THE WHOLE PRACTICE OF N90 NOT WORKING THIS TFC IS AN UNSAFE PROC. THIS SECTOR AND SPECIFICALLY THIS PROC WAS UCR'ED OVER 6 MONTHS AGO. SO FAR; NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND THIS EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATES HOW UNSAFE IT IS. WE; THE CTLRS OF AREA E; HOWEVER; WHO ARE STUCK WORKING THIS PROC; MAKE IT WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE TO. ZNY AND N90 HAVE ALL BUT REFUSED TO EVEN DISCUSS ANY PLAUSIBLE SOLUTIONS. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING AS N90 REFUSES TO WORK CLBING AND DSNDING TFC IN THEIR SECTORS; EVEN THOUGH THEIR SEPARATION MINIMA IS SMALLER THAN OURS. AND WE WORKED THE SAME AIRSPACE WITH MORE TFC THAN THEY DO NOW. HOPEFULLY; THIS LETTER WILL LEAD TO IMPROVE THE PROCS IN THIS SECTOR AND THE WORKABILITY/FLEXIBILITY/RELATIONSHIP WITH N90.

WHEN IT 'POPPED' INTO VIEW JUST ABOVE AND SLIGHTLY TO THE L OF MY COWLING; IT WAS APPROX 100 FT AHEAD AND BELOW MY PATH. THE GLIDER PLT MAY HAVE SEEN ME ALSO AT THAT POINT AS IT SEEMED THAT HE BEGAN TO ARREST HIS RATE OF ASCENT. SINCE HE WAS IN A RISING PATH THAT I JUDGED WOULD TAKE HIM RIGHTWARD ACROSS MY FRONT; I DID NOT EXECUTE A RIGHTWARD EVASIVE MOVEMENT; BUT INSTEAD IMMEDIATELY GAVE FULL THROTTLE TO CLB OVER WHAT I JUDGED HIS 'BACK' PATH TO BE.

174,3500,6,WE DEPARTED RWY 22R AT BOS AT XX46 LCL. OUR DEP INSTRUCTIONS WERE AN INITIAL CLB TO 3000 FT WITH A R TURN AFTER TKOF TO 300 DEGS. AFTER CONTACTING DEP CTL; WE WERE CLRED TO 4000 FT ON THE SAME HDG. ATC THEN ISSUED A TA FOR VFR TFC AT 11 O'CLOCK 2-3 MI AT 3500 FT CIRCLING.

THE INITIAL CONFLICT WAS CAUSED BY THE 3500 FT VFR TFC CIRCLING BELOW US; AS PER THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM; AS WE WERE CLBING TO 4000 FT. THE RA CAUSED ME TO CLB THROUGH 4000 FT CREATING A POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH 5000 FT TFC. SINCE THIS IS THE SECOND SITUATION I HAVE ENCOUNTERED LIKE THIS IN THE LAST 4 MONTHS; I AM PERHAPS IN A POS TO SUGGEST THAT ATC BE GIVEN SOME TRAINING ON THE WORKINGS OF TCASII.

175,9000,5,WE HAD JUST CROSSED BDR VOR AND WERE INTERCEPTING THE 054 DEG RADIAL FOR V229. TCASII ISSUED TA (INTRUDER) AT 1:30 -300. MOMENTS LATER ATC CALLED THE TFC AS UNCONFIRMED VFR. WE DID NOT SEE HIM. THEN TCASII ISSUED RA (THREAT) 'CLB.' I DISCONNECTED AUTOPLT AND CLBED AT THE INDICATED RATE FROM 9000 TO 9300 AT WHICH POINT TCASII ANNOUNCED 'CLR OF CONFLICT.' THE FO SIGHTED THE THREAT ACFT AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY BENEATH US. DURING THE CLB WE HAD ADVISED ATC OF THE RA AND OUR RESPONSE TO IT. ATC WAS UNAWARE THAT WE WERE TCASII EQUIPPED AS THE COMPANY HAD NOT FILED THE FLT PLAN TO INDICATE SUCH. HE HAD NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR A TCASII EVENT.

176,14500,0,APCHING GDM ON THE GARDNER 2 ARR BOS CTR POINTED OUT VFR TFC AT APPROX 12 O'CLOCK. OUR CLRNC WAS TO CROSS BRONC AT 11000. BOS MENTIONED THAT OUR TFC WAS WBOUND AND WOULD LEVEL AT 14500. WE THOUGHT THE CTLR WOULD PLAN OUR DSCNT BELOW 14500 BEFORE THE PASSING POINT. BOS CTR NEVER STOPPED OUR DSCNT NOR DID THEY STOP THE OTHER ACFT'S CLB. WE REALIZED A POTENTIAL PROBLEM FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN TCASII ISSUED AN RA. TCASII SAID 'REDUCE YOUR DSCNT' AND SO I DID. I REDUCED THE DSCNT TO 0 FPM AS WE LEVELED AT 14300 AND THAT IS WHEN THE ACFT PASSED ABEAM ON OUR PORT SIDE. WE HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT DURING THE ENTIRE EPISODE; BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE JUST WHERE HE WAS IN RELATION TO OUR POS. AFTER PASSING; WE QUESTIONED BOS AS TO HIS POS AND ALT. THE RESPONSE WAS DEFENSIVE AND THE CTLR STATED THAT HE TOLD US WE COULD LEVEL AT 15000 UNTIL TFC PASSED IF WE WISHED TO! NO ONE IN MY CREW HEARD THAT XMISSION. THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE VFR TFC SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FLY AGAINST GARDENER-2 ARR TFC AND CLBING THROUGH OUR DSCNT ALT. AVOIDANCE TURNS COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED; ALT CHANGES COULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED. MORE AND BETTER COM COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MAKE EACH OF US MORE FULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION. THE CTLR MUST HAVE WATCHED THE 2 OF US COME TOGETHER ON HIS RADAR SCREEN AT THE SAME ALT; HE MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE SCENARIO DEVELOPING -- YET; HE SAT THERE WATCHING ALL THIS DEVELOP AND SAID NOTHING! SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 209780: AT 16000 FT AND 5 MI W OF GARDNER; THE CAPT PULLED OUT THE SPDBRAKES TO INCREASE OUR RATE OF DSCNT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE XING RESTRICTION. AT SOME POINT; I HEARD THE CTLR SAY SOMETHING ABOUT '15000;' BUT DID NOT CATCH THE WHOLE XMISSION AND ASSUMED THAT HE WAS TELLING US THAT THE TFC WAS AT 15000 FT. OUR FO DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALL. I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC MIGHT BE GETTING CLOSE TO US SO I KEPT MY EYE ON HIM. AT APPROX 15000 FT OUR TCASII GAVE US A VERBAL RA OF 'REDUCE DSCNT; REDUCE DSCNT.' THIS CERTAINLY CAUGHT MY ATTN SO I GLANCED AT THE TCASII INST WHICH SHOWED A RED ARC ON THE LOWER HALF OF THE CASE. I DID NOT FOCUS MY EYES ON THE INST BECAUSE I WANTED TO CLR FOR THE TFC. THE CAPT STARTED TO STOP OUR DSCNT AT THIS POINT. AT APPROX 14500 FT I SAW THE TFC PASS OFF OUR L WING WITHIN 1/4 MI AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME ALT. BEING THAT IT WAS NIGHT; I CAN ONLY GUESS AT THE HORIZ DISTANCE. OUR CAPT HAD NOT MADE ANY EVASIVE TURN; AND I NOTICED THAT OUR ALT BOTTOMED OUT AT 14300 FT AS WE PASSED OVER GARDNER VOR. THE CTLR NEVER ISSUED US ANY TURNS OR ALT CHANGES. THE VFR TFC DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONFLICT. A FEW MI LATER; OUR FO TOLD THE CTR THAT WE HAD SEEN THE TFC PASS US AND ASKED WHAT ALT HE WAS AT. THE CTLR SAID HE WAS AT 14500 FT. AT THIS POINT; THE VFR TFC SAID HE THOUGH WE WERE TOLD THAT 'IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE MAINTAIN 15000 FT.' THE CTLR SAID NOTHING. MY AIRPLANE'S CREW MEMBERS NEVER HEARD THE 'SUGGESTION' AND CERTAINLY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY SUCH XMISSION AT THE TIME. IN MY MIND; THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION; I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC WAS MAINTAINING 15000 FT AND THAT WE WOULD BE DSNDING WELL IN FRONT OF HIM. I FEEL THAT THE ATC CTLR'S LACK OF AGGRESSIVENESS; FAILURE TO CTL HIS AIRSPACE; AND OVERALL NONCHALANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TFC CONFLICT.

ON THE DOWNWIND THERE WAS A TFC CONFLICT. THERE WAS AN INBOUND SMA ABOUT 200 FT BELOW AND 100 FT TO MY L. HE RPTED THIS TO THE TWR WHO THEN BERATED ME. THE TWR SAID HE HAD TOLD ME TO MAKE A L DOWNWIND DEP. I DON'T THINK THE TWR SAID THAT.

WHEN ACFT WERE APPROX 10 MI APART; TFC WAS EXCHANGED. SMA Y WAS MISRPTED TO MLG X AS BEING AN SMA YA TYPE. SMA Y RPTED MLG X IN SIGHT. MLG X WAS STILL LOOKING FOR THE TFC. AT THIS POINT THE DATA TAGS OVERLAPPED AND WERE BASICALLY UNREADABLE. (NO EXCUSE FOR THIS I WASN'T BUSY ENOUGH TO INSURE THAT THEY DIDN'T.) MLG X THEN SHOUTED 'IS IT AN SMA Y?' I REPLIED THAT IT MIGHT BE. HE SHOULD BE PASSING BENEATH HIM AT THAT TIME (DATA TAGS UNREADABLE). MLG X THEN RPTED THAT THE TFC HAD JUST OVERFLOWN HIM. WHEN DATA TAGS SEPARATED THE SMA Y WAS 1/2 MI BEHIND AND 100 FT ABOVE MLG X. WHEN QUESTIONED THE SMA Y PLT STATED HE WAS TRYING TO AVOID MLG X WAKE TURB. THE PROBLEM HERE WAS THAT THE PLT DID NOT RPT CHANGING HIS ALT AND THAT I ALLOWED THE DATA TAGS TO OVERLAP AND THEREFORE DID NOT SEE THE SMA Y CLBING THROUGH HIS SUPPOSED CRUISING ALT. HOPEFULLY A LESSON LEARNED ON BOTH PARTS. ALSO: WHEN PASSING TFC; ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THE CORRECT ACFT TYPE IF AVAILABLE.

AT THIS TIME I ALREADY STARTED EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID THE JET AND HIS WAKE TURB BY CLBING AND A L TURN TO 7000.

THE TARGET WAS SHOWN ON TCASII TO BE CLBING; AND NOT DIVERGING FROM OUR COURSE. AS WE CONTINUED UNDER CTL OF ATC; THE INTRUDER CONTINUED TO CLB UNTIL THE TCASII ISSUED A TA. BOTH THE COPLT AND MYSELF WERE ATTEMPTING TO LOCATE THE TARGET VISUALLY; BUT COULD NOT SEE IT. AS THE INTRUDER CONTINUED TO CLB; OUR TCASII ISSUED AN RA AND ORDERED A CLB. AS WE INITIATED A CLB; WE SPOTTED THE TARGET JUST BELOW AND R OF OUR ACFT ON THE SAME HDG AND CLBING. WE CLBED TO APPROX 5800 FT AS COMMANDED BY OUR TCASII AND RETURNED TO 5000 FT UPON CLRING THE OTHER ACFT. I ADVISED ATL WHEN WE STARTED OUR CLB; AND AGAIN CALLED WHEN RETURNING TO OUR ASSIGNED ALT.

SINCE I WAS NEW TO THE AREA I ARRIVED APPROX 1/2 MI TO THE N. A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO A R DOWNWIND TO RWY 20 WOULD HAVE REQUIRED AN ARR ON THE S SIDE SO TO ESTABLISH MYSELF ON R DOWNWIND I BEGAN TO CIRCLE THE ARPT IN A WIDE R TURN. WHEN ABEAM THE APCH END OF RWY 20; HDG 20 DEGS I NOTICED A SINGLE ENG ACFT AT MY ALT ON A L DOWNWIND TO RWY 20. TO ALLOW THE OTHER ACFT RIGHT OF WAY; I KEPT TO HIS L APPROX 500 FT. WHEN THE OTHER ACFT WAS OFF MY R WING I HEARD HIM CALL THE TWR AND ASK IF THEY KNEW I WAS THERE. THE CTLR RESPONDED BY CALLING ME AND ASKING IF I WAS CIRCLING; WHEN I ACKNOWLEDGED HE ASKED WHAT MY INTENTIONS WERE. I RESPONDED BY TELLING HIM THAT I WAS CIRCLING THE ARPT TO ESTABLISH MYSELF ON A R DOWNWIND TO RWY 20 AS REQUESTED. THE CTLR RESPONDED BY TELLING ME TO TURN 180 DEGS TO THE L AND ESTABLISH MYSELF ON A L DOWNWIND TO RWY 20 AND TO REMAIN ON THE FREQ. WHEN I WAS ABEAM RWY 20 ON L DOWNWIND THE CTLR CLRED ME TO LAND; HE THEN WENT ON TO ASK IF I HAD APCHED THE ARPT FROM THE W; I ANSWERED THAT WAS AFFIRMATIVE; THEN HE ASKED IF I WAS DISORIENTED AND I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS JUST NEW TO THE AREA. IN RETROSPECT I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CTLR A POS RPT WHEN I FIRST HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT GIVING HIM THE OPTION OF ISSUING NEW INSTRUCTIONS. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT SINCE THE CTLR WAS EXPECTING ME TO BE ARRIVING AT THE ARPT; HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY MY PRESENCE.

198,3000,9,I WAS PIC OF AN SMT TWIN ON AN AIR TAXI FLT FROM PORTLAND; ME; TO LEBANON; NH; ON DEC/XX/92. THE FLT WAS CONDUCTED UNDER AN IFR FLT PLAN. I WAS CLRED FOR A VOR A APCH TO LEBANON ARPT. I HAD CROSSED THE VOR AT 4000 FT AND HAD PROCEEDED OUTBOUND AND COMPLETED THE PROC TURN INBOUND. I HAD ESTABLISHED THE INBOUND COURSE AND WAS DSNDING TO 3000 FT TO WAIT TO CROSS THE HANOVER MARKER BEACON; TO THEN DSND. WHILE AT 3000 FT; I HEARD A LOUD BANG AND SLIGHT SHUDDER OF THE ACFT. THE ACFT FLEW NORMALLY AND I THOUGHT I HAD THROWN ICE FROM A PROP BLADE. A NORMAL APCH AND LNDG WAS MADE. AFTER DISCHARGING MY PAX; I DID A CIRCLE CHK OF THE ACFT. IT WAS THEN I FOUND A TEAR INTO THE WING SKIN ON THE L WING BTWN THE FUSELAGE AND THE ENG NACELLE. THIS TEAR WAS ON THE LEADING EDGE OF THE WING AND WENT INTO THE WING APPROX 4 INCHES; I TOOK A FLASHLIGHT AND EXAMINED INTO THE WING. I COULD EASILY SEE ALL WIRES AND LINES IN THE WING AND DETERMINED THAT NONE WERE DAMAGED; FRAYED OR DISTURBED. I THEN RAN THE L ENG AND ALL ACCESSORIES ON THE L WING (LIGHTS; GAUGES; ETC) AND DETERMINED THAT ALL WERE WORKING NORMALLY. I COULD HEAR THE FUEL PUMP WORKING ALSO. I DOUBLECHKED TO SEE THAT THERE WERE NO FUEL LEAKS. I THEN USED DUCT TAPE TO CLOSE THE TEAR IN THE WING. AFTER A THOROUGH RUNUP I PROCEEDED ON AN IFR FLT PLAN BACK TO LEWISTON; ME. I BELIEVE THAT THE GASH WAS CAUSED BY FAIRLY STRONG WINDS BLOWING OVER THE MOUNTAINS MAY HAVE CARRIED TREE BRANCHES INTO THE AIR. OTHER THAN THE DAMAGED WING AND IMPACT DENTS ON L STABILIZER; NO OTHER MARKS WERE ON ACFT. MANY ANTENNAS AND LIGHTS ON BELLY OF FUSELAGE WHICH ARE LOWER THAN IMPACT AREA WERE UNTOUCHED. I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE ACFT PERFORMED NORMALLY BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE IMPACT WAS FELT. USING THE DUCT TAPE; THE WING GASH WAS COMPLETELY COVERED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SHAPE OF THE WING. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR HAS RECEIVED LETTER OF INVESTIGATION FROM THE FAA CONCERNING THIS INCIDENT. THOUGHT THAT PROP SPINNER ICE MAY HAVE BROKEN OFF IN A LARGE CHUNK AND CAUSED ACFT WING LEADING EDGE DAMAGE. HE DOES NOT HAVE AN A&P MECHS CERTIFICATE.

WE HAD DSNDED FROM CRUISE ALT TO 16000 FT FOR OUR ARR TO BDL AND WERE INBOUND TO THE MAD VOR. (NORMAL XING AT MAD IS 11000 FT; 250 KTS.)

202,2500,4,WHILE ON AN INST TRAINING FLT IN VMC WITH A STUDENT; I CONTACTED NEW YORK APCH TO REQUEST THE ILS 36 INTO WATERBURY OXFORD ARPT; LOW APCH ONLY. ATC RPTED HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE RADAR COVERAGE BUT ADVISED WE COULD SHOOT THE APCH ON OUR OWN USING THE CTAF. I RESPONDED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE USING THE CTAF BUT WOULD ALSO STICK WITH NEW YORK FOR ANY ADVISORIES HE COULD PROVIDE. THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE WHILE MY STUDENT AND I CRUISED AT 2500 FT DIRECT TO CLERA LOM FROM MERIDEN MARKHAM (MMK). I CALLED ON THE CTAF TO ADVISE LCL TFC OF OUR POS AND ALT AS WELL AS OUR INTENTION OF SHOOTING THE APCH. UPON REACHING THE LOM; MY STUDENT RAISED HIS L WING SO I COULD CLR THE AREA. SEEING NO TFC; I CLRED HIM TO TURN INTO THE HOLD ENTRY FOR COURSE REVERSAL. ONCE IN OUR STANDARD RATE TURN; I SAW A WHITE SMA WITH RED STRIPES ALMOST DIRECTLY BELOW US. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED AS THE TURN WAS TAKING US AWAY FROM THE LOWER TFC. IT APPEARED HE HAD BEEN COMING FROM OUR 7-8 O'CLOCK POS. THE OTHER SMA HELD HIS COURSE AND ALT AND CONTINUED ON TO THE W UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT. I CAN ONLY ASSUME HE NEVER SAW US AND WAS UNAWARE OF OUR CLOSE PROX. THE ONLY CAUSES I CAN IMAGINE IN THIS INSTANCE WERE A COMBINATION OF A POOR SCAN BY THE LOWER ACFT AS HE OVERTOOK MY OWN; AND HIS APPARENT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR POS DUE TO NOT MONITORING THE LCL RADIO FREQ. WHILE OXC IS AN UNCTLED ARPT; NOT REQUIRING RADIOS; I THINK A HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF A PLT OPTS TO FLY THROUGH THE AREA SURROUNDING AN ARPT OF THIS SIZE AND WITH AS MUCH TFC AS IS IN THE AIR ON A REGULAR BASIS.

WE WERE FLYING ASSIGNED HDG 150 DEGS; 250 KTS AND HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CLRED DOWN TO 5000 FT. AT APPROX XA00Z; WITH OUR CURRENT ALT AT ABOUT 6500 FT; THE CTLR ADVISED US TO STOP DSCNT AT 6000 FT. HE CALLED OUT KNOWN TFC AT 2 O'CLOCK AT 5500 FT. WE SEARCHED FOR AND VISUALLY LOCATED THE TFC PASSING R TO L JUST ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE TCASII STARTED A TA 'TFC; TFC.' ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TCASII BEGAN AN RA 'MONITOR VERT SPD.' THE BOTTOM OF THE IVSI WAS RED AS WE WERE PASSING 6300 FT TO LEVEL AT 6000 FT. AT THAT EXACT MOMENT WE PASSED DIRECTLY BENEATH A GLIDER. THERE WAS NO TIME FOR EVASIVE ACTION AND NONE WAS TAKEN. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN ALT; BUT IT WAS PROBABLY LESS THAN 500 FT. THE EVENT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY FREQ CHANGE TO THE FINAL CTLR. I MADE A COMMENT TO THE CTLR ABOUT ENCOUNTERING THE GLIDER TO WHICH HE DIDN'T RESPOND. I ASKED THE NEXT CTLR IF THE GLIDERS HAD XPONDERS; TO WHICH HE REPLIED THEY DID NOT. APCH CTL APPARENTLY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE GLIDER OPS. WHILE WE WERE ON TWR FREQ; GLIDER CALLED AND TOLD THE TWR THAT IF THE '...PLANE THAT HE HAD JUST HAD A NEAR MISS WITH' WANTED TO TALK TO HIM; TO COME UP ON 123.3.

THE CAPT WAS FLYING; AND IN THE AREA OF HANCOCK VOR WE WERE CLRED DIRECT BRADLEY VOR. APCHING BRADLEY WE WERE CLRED TO 14000 FT. THE DSCNT WAS STARTED AND APCHING BRADLEY VOR; THE CAPT QUESTIONED ZBW ABOUT THE ROUTING BEYOND BRADLEY. THE CAPT ASSUMED THAT THE CLRNC DIRECT BRADLEY WAS OFF OF OUR FLT PLANNED RTE. HE WAS UNAWARE THAT OUR FLT PLANNED RTE; WHICH WAS NOW ON THE LOW CHART AS V-130; CONTINUED THROUGH THE BRADLEY VOR (BRADLEY VOR WAS NOT LISTED AS A FIX ON OUR ATC RTE OF FLT CLRNC). WHILE I WAS TRYING TO INFORM THE CAPT OF THIS; HE WAS ON THE RADIO WITH ZBW. THE ACFT PASSED OVER BRADLEY VOR WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN HDG REQUIRED TO CAPTURE V-130. DURING THE COMS; AN RA CAME UP ON THE TCASII. THE CAPT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE RA WHICH OCCURRED AT 15000-15500 FT. A CLB WAS STARTED; AND ATC NOTIFIED. THE INTRUDING ACFT WAS ACQUIRED VISUALLY. AT 16000 FT THE CONFLICT WAS CLRED; AND DSCNT WAS RESUMED TO 14000 FT. ZBW THEN ASSIGNED VECTORS TO PROVIDENCE. THERE WAS NO FURTHER COMMENT ON THE INCIDENT. THIS INCIDENT WAS A RESULT OF THE CAPT'S UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE RTE. IN PARTICULAR; THE POINT OF CHANGEOVER BTWN JETWAY AND VECTOR AIRWAY ROUTING. BETTER FAMILIARITY IN THE FUTURE WILL HOPEFULLY PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. THERE IS A PUBLISHED ARR ROUTING FOR THE PROVIDENCE ARPT. IT ESSENTIALLY DUPLICATES THE ROUTING WE WERE GIVEN. HAD IT BEEN ISSUED IN OUR ATC CLRNC THIS INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM ACN 241223: THE CONFUSION COULD BE AVOIDED BY MY BEING MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE RTE AND BETTER PREPARED.

THE PLT OF THIS ACFT THEN CALLED ON UNICOM FREQ AND SAID THAT I HAD CUT HIM OFF. I ASKED WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE; AS IT APPEARED HE HAD BEEN UPWIND IN THE DOWNWIND LEG FOR RWY 28. HE REPLIED HE HAD BEEN TAKING OFF. I HAD NO FURTHER CONVERSATION WITH THIS PLT. AS I HAD NOT SEEN THE SMA 2 PRIOR TO THE NEAR MISS I CAN ONLY SPECULATE THAT HE HAD MADE A L TURN AFTER TKOF; THEN A R TURN WBOUND; OR THAT HIS AIRPLANE HAD BEEN BLOWN OFF CTRLINE OF THE DEP COURSE OF RWY 28 AS THE WIND WAS OUT OF THE NW.,2 sma 'S AN nmac IN AN unctl arpt tfc pattern .

AS WE BEGAN OUR R TURN FOR THE L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 5; WE WERE TOLD THAT WE WOULD BE '#4 FOR THE ARPT FOLLOWING AN SMA X ON A STRAIGHT IN VISUAL APCH TO RWY 5.' I PICKED OUT THE 2 SMA Y'S ON FINAL AND THEN IT SEEMED LIKE 20 SECONDS BEFORE WE PICKED OUT THE SMA X WHO MUCH TO OUR SURPRISE; WAS FLYING DIRECT TO THE NUMBERS (TO RWY 5) AND HAD SUBSEQUENTLY CROSSED THE DOWNWIND TFC INCLUDING US TO GET THERE. THE SMA X WAS ON WHAT SEEMED LIKE A HEAD-ON COLLISION COURSE TO US AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR OUR SWIFT EVASIVE MANEUVERS; IT MIGHT HAVE ENDED IN TRAGEDY. THE SMA Y DID NOT TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTIONS TO MISS US AND I QUESTION IF THE PLT WAS EVEN AWARE OF HIS EXACT POS RELATIVE TO US AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE. THEN; WHEN WE WERE ESTABLISHED ON FINAL FOR RWY 5; AT APPROX 1 MI OUT; HANSCOM TWR THEN INSTRUCTED US TO TURN R TO ENTER THE L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 29; WHICH WE DID PROMPTLY.

HOWEVER; BED TWR DOES HAVE A D-BRITE RADAR SCREEN IN THE TWR AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THIS 'NEAR MISS' (I HOPE). MAYBE THE ANSWER IS TO SEE IF THAT TYPE OF RADAR CAN BE ENHANCED ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTIRE TFC PATTERN FLOW IS MUCH MORE EASILY SEEN ON SCREEN FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO FLY. WHEN THE TFC PATTERN STARTS TO GET QUITE BUSY; I SUSPECT THAT THE TWR CTLR WOULD WELCOME ANY AID OR DEVICE TO MAKE THEIR DIFFICULT JOB THAT MUCH EASIER.,sma ha nmac ON practic il apch circl TO land .

UPON SEEKING OUT THE PLT ON THE GND; HE SHOWED NO REMORSE OR AWARENESS OF THE DANGER OF HIS ACTION. HE BLAMED THE INCIDENT ON THE TWR AND ALSO STATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN 'PLENTY OF ROOM' BTWN US.

THERE WAS A CUMULUS BUILDUP BTWN US AND THE CONFLICTING TFC. WE OBSERVED THE ACFT ON TCASII; HOWEVER; OUR TCASII SYS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AUTHORIZED FOR RA; THUS; NO RA'S WERE GIVEN BY THE TCASII. THE OTHER ACFT THEN STARTED A DSCNT DOWN TO 8300 FT AND CONTINUED ITS DSCNT AND SW COURSE ACROSS OUR FLT PATH. BRADLEY CTLR CALLED THE OTHER ACFT TWICE; THE SECOND TIME VERY FRANTICALLY. THE CTLR THEN TOLD US THE TFC WASN'T ANSWERING HIM. WE WERE LOOKING FOR HIM WHEN AT THE LAST MIN MY FO SAW HIM AND POINTED TO OUR 10 O'CLOCK POS. OUT OF MY PERIPHERY I SAW AN ACFT HDG FOR US. I PULLED THE ACFT UP TO 8500 FT AND AVOIDED A COLLISION. THE ABRUPT MANEUVER RESULTED IN A FLT ATTENDANT FALLING DOWN IN THE GALLEY AREA; SEVERELY INJURING HER ANKLE. THE LIGHT ACFT PASSED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND US AND CONTINUED ON ITS WAY; VFR. BRADLEY ATC WAS NOTIFIED OF MY INTENT TO FILE A NEAR MISS RPT. HAVING A FULLY OPERATIONAL TCASII WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HELPED IN THIS EVENT. IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US AN RA MUCH SOONER AND AVOIDED THE ABRUPT MANEUVER. WE NEVER SAW THE LIGHT ACFT UNTIL HE CAME AROUND FROM BEHIND THE BUILDUP. ALSO; THE FRANTIC CHATTER ON THE RADIO WAS DISTRACTING TO SAY THE LEAST AND INHIBITED US FROM CALLING THE CTLR TO GET MORE INFO FROM HIM. THE VFR ACFT LATER SAID HE HAD US IN VISUAL CONTACT BUT COULDN'T SAY SO BECAUSE HE COULDN'T XMIT DUE TO THE CTLR CONSTANTLY TALKING.

229,1500,3,I DEPARTED BARNSTABLE MUNICIPAL ARPT ON AN IFR FLT PLAN WHICH WOULD TAKE MYSELF AND MY INST STUDENT TO NANTUCKET; MA; ON AN INST TRAINING FLT. WE DEPARTED RWY 15; WE PENETRATED THE OVCST AT 500-600 FT; AND WERE PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED BY HYANNIS TWR TO CONTACT CAPE APCH. I CHANGED FREQS AND CONTACTED APCH CTL. I BRIEFLY TOOK MY EYES OFF OF THE INSTS; AS I FELT CONFIDENT IN MY STUDENT'S ABILITY TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE UNDER CTL BY REF TO INSTS. I RETURNED MY EYES BACK TO THE INST PANEL. I NOTICED THAT THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR WAS SHOWING THE ACFT TO BE IN A FAIRLY STEEP DSNDING BANK TO THE R. I BEGAN TO TELL MY STUDENT TO CORRECT FOR THIS. HE SAID 'SOMETHING'S WRONG.' AFTER XCHKING THE INSTS; I COULD SEE THAT IN FACT WE WERE IN A CLBING L BANK. I HESITATED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT; REFUSING TO BELIEVE MY INSTS; THEN IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED A VACUUM FAILURE. TAKING CTL OF THE AIRPLANE I BEGAN TO LEVEL THE WINGS; AND DECREASE OUR PITCH; AS I COULD SEE OUR AIRSPD DECREASING. I CONTACTED CAPE APCH AND ADVISED THEM OF OUR SIT; REQUESTING VECTORS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO HYANNIS. THEY RESPONDED AND ASKED IF I WISHED TO DECLARE AN EMER; TO WHICH I ANSWERED 'NEGATIVE;' FEARING THE POSSIBLE PAPERWORK AND QUESTIONS TO ANSWER IF I DID SO. I LEVELED OFF AT MY ASSIGNED ALT OF 1700 FT AND WAS SO FOCUSED ON TRYING TO CTL THE AIRPLANE WITH NO ATTITUDE INDICATOR; THAT I FAILED TO REALIZE THAT THE AIRPLANE HAD DEVIATED TO THE N; FROM OUR INITIALLY ASSIGNED HDG OF 150 DEGS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; CAPE APCH INSTRUCTED ME TO MAKE A CLBING R TURN TO 3000 FT AND A HDG OF 200 DEGS. AS I BEGAN FIGURING OUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO TURN USING A TIMED TURN AT A STANDARD RATE; APCH CALLED BACK AGAIN WITH THE SAME INSTRUCTION; AND A SENSE OF URGENCY. I DID MY BEST TO COMPLETE AN ACCURATE TIMED TURN; WHILE CLBING; BUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY AT HAND FORCED ME TO COUNT TOO QUICKLY; RESULTING IN AN EARLY ROLLOUT AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE VECTOR IN A TIMELY MANNER. I LEVELED OUT AT 3000 FT AND NOTICED THAT THE HDG INDICATOR AND MAGNETIC COMPASS SHOWED THE SAME HDG; AND THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR SEEMED TO BE WORKING. HOWEVER; I DECIDED THAT I WOULD NOT TRUST THEM AND WOULD KEEP THEM OUT OF MY SCAN; USING ONLY MY REMAINING INSTS; AND USING TIMED TURNS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH VECTOR HDGS. CAPT APCH CALLED BACK; AND THE CTLR GAVE ME A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL WHEN I LANDED; AND INSTRUCTED ME TO ASK FOR THE SHIFT SUPVR. I BEGAN TO FEEL ADDED TENSION IN AN ALREADY TENSE SIT; AS I BELIEVED THAT THIS MEANT I WOULD BE IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE. I WAS THEN GIVEN SEVERAL VECTORS; WITH WHICH I TRIED MY BEST TO COMPLY USING TIMED TURNS; AND A MAGNETIC COMPASS; BUT HAD LIMITED SUCCESS; DEVIATING FROM MOST OF THEM DUE TO THE ADDED TENSION WHICH I FELT. I WAS THEN TOLD TO DSND TO 1700 FT AND EXPECT AN ILS APCH TO HYANNIS. FOCUSING MAINLY ON TRYING TO CTL THE AIRPLANE; AND MAINTAINING MY HDG USING ONLY A MAGNETIC COMPASS; I DSNDED TO APPROX 1200 FT BEFORE BEING TOLD BY THE CTLR THAT I WAS TOO LOW AND HAD TO CLB BACK UP TO 1700 FT. APCH CTL; SHORTLY THEREAFTER; CALLED BACK AND ASKED IF I WAS RECEIVING THE LOC. I LOOKED TO SEE IF I WAS; AND ALL I SAW IN BOTH WINDOWS WERE 'NAV' FLAGS. I RESPONDED THAT I WAS NOT RECEIVING THE LOC; AND AFTER SEVERAL EXCHANGES WITH ATC I REALIZED THAT THEY WERE GIVING ME THE ILS 24 APCH; AND I WAS EXPECTING THE ILS 25 APCH; FOR WHICH I WAS ALREADY SET UP. I QUICKLY LOOKED UP THE ILS 24 APCH PLATE; AND MANAGED TO GET THE CORRECT FREQS FOR THE APCH AND GET SET UP. I WAS VECTORED BACK TO THE 24 LOC; AND THE NEEDLE BEGAN TO COME IN SHORTLY THEREAFTER. CAPE APCH THEN CLRED ME FOR THE APCH; ADVISING ME THAT I WAS 2 MI FROM THE OM. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE CTLR CALLED ME BACK AND ADVISED ME TO CHK MY ALTIMETER SETTING; BECAUSE HE WAS GETTING A LOW ALT ALERT ON ME. I LOOKED AT MY ALTIMETER; AND SAW THAT I WAS AT 1000 FT AND LOOKING AT THE APCH PLATE; THE PROC MANDATES MAINTAINING 1700 FT UNTIL GS INTERCEPT. I BEGAN TO CLB BACK UP; AND RAPIDLY INTERCEPTED THE GS; AND BEGAN A DSCNT AGAIN. I THEN REALIZED THAT I HAD WANDERED OFF OF THE LOC AND REINTERCEPTED IT. AFTER A COUPLE OF DEVS FROM THE GS AND LOC; I BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AT APPROX 500 FT AND LANDED ON RWY 24 WITHOUT ANY FURTHER OCCURRENCES. UPON TAXIING IN AND SHUTTING THE AIRPLANE DOWN; I CALLED APCH CTL ON THE TELEPHONE; AS INSTRUCTED. THE CTLR THEN ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENED; AND AFTER MY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS; ADVISED ME THAT I HAD COME WITHIN 400 FT OF ANOTHER ACFT. UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THE EVENTS AS THEY OCCURRED; I REALIZE THAT THE SIT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS SEVERE IF I HAD MAINTAINED A CONSTANT SCAN OF THE INST PANEL; AND TAKEN CTL OF THE ACFT FROM MY STUDENT SOONER. FURTHER DEVS FROM ATC INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF I MAINTAINED A BETTER SCAN; NOT FOCUSING SO MUCH ON THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A PROB WITH THE GYRO INSTS. ADDITIONALLY; THE AIR TFC CTLR'S ACTIONS OF GIVING ME A TELEPHONE NUMBER; AND INSTRUCTIONS TO CALL AS SOON AS I LANDED; DID NOT HELP THE SIT.,instructor inst student vacuum pump failur IN imc . unabl TO compli alt vector issu .

ONLY RESTRICTIONS ZBW HAD WAS TO NOTIFY THEM AT THE END OF EACH SBOUND RUN WHEN TURNING N TO START THE TEST RUN AGAIN. WE STARTED RUN #5 SBOUND. ZBW ASKED US HOW MUCH LONGER WE WOULD BE MAKING THESE ORBITS TODAY. WE ANSWERED THAT WE WOULD BE MAKING 2 MORE RUNS. WE WERE HDG 280 DEGS MAGNETIC AND JUST STARTING A L 60 DEG BANK TURN WHEN CTR CLRED ACR FLT TO TURN L 15 DEGS AND TO CLB TO FL390. CTR THEN SAID TO US THAT HE NEEDED TO KNOW WHEN WE MAKE OUR TURNS.

SOMETIME DURING THOSE PAST 10 SECONDS ACR AND WE GOT PRETTY CLOSE TOGETHER; ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER. I BELIEVE THE PROB WAS THAT WE HAD BEEN DOING THE SAME MANEUVER FOR THE PREVIOUS RUNS BUT ON THIS RUN WE CHANGED THE MANEUVER SLIGHTLY; HOLDING THE 60 DEG BANK TURNS FOR A LONGER TIME THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.

231,600,2,TODAY'S FLT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A 'PLEASURE' FLT IN AN SMA TO SHOW MY GIRLFRIEND THE FALL COLORS. AS COULD BE EXPECTED THE VFR TFC WAS HVY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL HOLIDAY. COMBINE THIS WITH THE COMPLICATED AIRSPACE AROUND THE TCA AT RELIEVER ARPTS INCREASES THE CHANCE OF A CONFLICT MANY FOLD. OFF HAND; I CAN THINK OF 2 POTENTIAL DANGEROUS INCIDENTS INVOLVING MY ACFT ON THIS FLT. THEY ARE: A POSSIBLE NEAR MISS IN THE TFC PATTERN. ON DEP FROM RWY 27; I WAS CLRED FOR A R DEP TO CROSS MIDFIELD ABOVE 1600 FT MSL. AT THE TIME OF THIS CLRNC; I WAS LOOKING INTO THE SUN WHILE SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS LNDG RWY 9. SO; WHEN I GLANCED AT THE ALTIMETER; I MISTAKENLY READ 1600 FT INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL 600 FT. THUS; I CHKED OUT OF 1600 MSL AND STARTED THE TURN FOR THE R DOWNWIND DEP. I DIDN'T SEE THE ACFT THAT RPTED THE CONFLICT. INSTEAD; I HEARD THE RADIO XMISSION TO TWR AND REALIZED THE MISTAKE. MY ACFT CROSSED THE RWY 16 PATTERN RIGHT AT PATTERN ALT DURING THE CLB. NOT GOOD! GENERAL THOUGHTS: 1) FLYING A LIGHT SINGLE CAN BE AS DEMEANING AS A TURBOJET. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN 'DOWNGRADING' TO A MORE BASIC ACFT; ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT FLYING ONE FOR A WHILE DUE TO BEING IN A LARGER ACFT. IT IS VERY EASY TO BECOME LOCKED INTO 'PROCS OF A 2-MAN CREW; OR WORSE YET; DEVELOP A 'COCKY' ATTITUDE FLYING THE TURBINE EQUIP. 2) AVOID EXPECTANCY! (I.E.; READING AN ALTIMETER WRONG). IT IS EASY IN A STRESSFUL SIT FOR THE MIND TO SEE WHAT IT IS EXPECTING TO SEE. THUS; WHEN A PERSON USUALLY FLIES ON ACFT CLBING AT 4000-7000 FPM; IT IS EASY TO THINK OF CLB IN TERMS OF FPM AS BEING A CONSTANT. THUS; 'I HAVE CLBED FOR 20 SECONDS; SO I SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS ALT' COMES TO MIND. 2 CONTRIBUTING SUB NOTES: A) DIFFERENCES IN ALTIMETERS. THE SMA HAS THE TYPICAL DARK TYPE OF ALTIMETER; WHERE MOST TURBOJET ACFT HAVE THE NUMERICAL READOUT FOR THOUSAND AND HUNDREDS OF FT. B) MY MIND HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED TO BE TURNING AT 1600 FT AS A RESULT OF FLYING THE TEB 2 DEP 4 NIGHTS A WK; WHICH CALLS FOR A TURN AT 1500 FT WHEN DEPARTING RWY 1. 3) CALM CAVU DAYS; ESPECIALLY HOLIDAYS BRING OUT ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS OF PLTS IN ABUNDANCE. THUS; CROSSED AIRSPACE BECOMES MORE CROWDED. READING CHARTS AND ANSWERING PAX QUESTIONS ARE DISTRS FROM LOOKING FOR OTHER ACFT AND FLYING THE ACFT. 4) WKEND VFR IN A LIGHT SINGLE IS HAZARDOUS.

232,1000,2,MY STUDENT AND I ENTERED THE PATTERN ON A L DOWNWIND TO RWY 32 AS INSTRUCTED. WE WERE VERY BUSY IN THE PLANE AND WE WERE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING OUR RADIO CALLS IN BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE FREQ AND IN THE PATTERN. ATC SAID WE WOULD BE FOLLOWING SMT TFC ON A 2 MI R BASE. APPARENTLY I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THE CALL; I HAD TFC ON THE L BASE AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT I WAS FOLLOWING. WE TURNED TO THE BASE LEG AND WERE ABOUT TO TURN FINAL WHEN ATC ASKED IF WE HAD THE TFC WE WERE FOLLOWING IN SIGHT. I REPLIED THAT WE HAD TFC ON SHORT FINAL. ATC THEN TOLD US TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE HARD L 360 DEG TURN. AS I STARTED THE TURN I SAW THE SMT BEHIND US; A COUPLE HUNDRED FT AWAY. THE SMT PASSED US AND LANDED; AND WE FOLLOWED AND LANDED. I BELIEVE FACTORS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THIS SIT INCLUDE THE FACT THAT MY ATTN WAS DIVIDED BTWN RECEIVING AND XMITTING RADIO CALLS; CORRECTING FOR A DIRECT 16 KT XWIND; INSTRUCTING MY STUDENT; AND WATCHING ALL THE TFC IN THE AREA; WHILE SETTING UP FOR LNDG. BECAUSE I WAS SO BUSY; I WAS NOT LISTENING AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD HAVE BEEN. FORTUNATELY ATC SAW THE SIT AND INFORMED ME; UPON WHICH I TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO CORRECT THE SIT.

241,1900,1,THE FLT WAS A ROUTINE SCHEDULED FLT FROM BOS TO BTV IN VMC WITH AN IFR FLT PLAN. UPON BEING CLRED THE VISUAL APCH WE WERE SWITCHED TO TWR. TWR TOLD US TO ENTER L DOWNWIND RWY 15 AND WE WOULD BE #3 FOLLOWING A MIG (YES; MIG) TURNING L BASE. A FEW SECONDS LATER A CESSNA; WHO WAS #1; RPTED HE HAD LOST HIS ENG ON HIS LNDG ROLL. WE HAD JUST PICKED UP THE MIG ON HIS L BASE WHEN THE TWR TOLD US TO MAKE A R 360 DEG TURN AND RETURN TO THE DOWNWIND. THE CAPT INITIATED THE TURN AND STOPPED THE DSCNT AT PATTERN ALT. WE LOST SIGHT OF THE MIG AS WE MADE THE TURN AND NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM AGAIN. THE LCL CTLR WAS QUESTIONING THE CESSNA PLT AS TO WHAT ASSISTANCE HE WOULD NEED TO GET OFF THE RWY. THE CESSNA PLT RESPONDED THAT HE HAD JUST RESTARTED HIS ENG AND WAS EXITING THE RWY. AT THIS POINT WE WERE 3/4 OF THE WAY THROUGH OUR TURN (PERPENDICULAR TO THE RWY). THE CAPT LOOKED OUT HIS WINDOW; YELLED SOMETHING AND DOVE THE AIRPLANE. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME; I LOOKED TOWARDS HIS WINDOW AND SAW THE MIG FLY RIGHT ACROSS OUR NOSE. HE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CLRLY SEE THE RED FLAG ON THE SIDE OF HIS FUSELAGE. JUST AFTER THE MIG PASSED; THE TWR CALLED HIM OUT AS TFC (TOO LITTLE; TOO LATE). I RESPONDED THAT WE HAD HIM IN SIGHT AND THE TWR MENTIONED HE WAS DOING 450 KTS. WE WERE THEN CLRED TO LAND BEHIND THE MIG (WHO AS IT TURNED OUT WAS DOING LOW APCHS). UPON ARR AT THE GATE I CALLED THE LCL CTLR ON THE PHONE TO DISCUSS THE SIT. HE TOLD ME WE HAD BEEN SPUN BECAUSE OF THE CESSNA; WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD; AND THAT HIS RADAR HAD FAILED AND THAT WAS WHY HE NEVER TOLD US ABOUT THE MIG UNTIL HE HAD PASSED US. HE SAID HE KNEW THE SPD OF THE MIG BECAUSE HIS RADAR SUDDENLY CAME BACK. WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM AS TO WHY THE MIG WAS GOING SO FAST IN THE FIRST PLACE; HE CORRECTLY EXPLAINED THAT THE MIG WAS EXEMPT FROM THE NORMAL 250 KT RESTR DUE TO ITS STALL CHARACTERISTICS. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE MIG EXCEEDING THE 250 KT RESTR BUT I DOUBT HE NEEDED TO BE DOING 450 KTS IN THE TFC PATTERN. AS PLTS; WE ARE TAUGHT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMER; FLY THE ACFT FIRST; THEN ADDRESS THE EMER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT CTLRS ARE TAUGHT BUT THIS LCL CTLR WAS OBVIOUSLY FIXATING ON THE ACFT ON THE GND AND APPARENTLY FORGOT ABOUT THE 2 ACFT IN HIS PATTERN.

NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED ALTHOUGH MISS WAS APPROX 50 FT VERT '0' HORIZONTAL. I FEEL CONTRADICTING FACTORS WERE: 1) NEITHER ACFT; ALTHOUGH RADIO EQUIPPED; WERE ANNOUNCING POS. 2) DUE TO SNOW ON GND AND BRIGHT SKIES AND COLOR OF OTHER ACFT BEING PRIMARILY WHITE; TFC WAS NOT EASY TO SEE. 3) WITH NO ALTIMETER SETTING AND DUE TO MY XCOUNTRY; FLT ALT WAS NOT AS THOUGHT.

MHT ATC WAS WORKING A SAAB 340 FLT Y IFR ENRTE TO BOS (DO-228 WAS ABOUT 3-5 MI AHEAD OF THE SAAB). MHT ATC ADVISED THE SAAB CREW THAT THEY HAD DO-228 TFC AT 12 O'CLOCK; 5 MI. SAAB CREW ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY WERE LOOKING. MHT ATC ASKED FLT X WHAT THE HDG WAS TO BOS; I STATED IT WAS 190 DEGS. MHT ATC ADVISED THE SAAB CREW OF MY HDG.

THE SAAB CREW CHKED IN THE ZBW AND STATED THAT THEY JUST HAD TO MAKE AN EMER MANEUVER TO AVOID HITTING A DORNIER. ZBW RESPONSE WAS ROGER! THE SAAB CREW THEN ASKED BOS WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE? WAS THE DO- 228 ROAMING AROUND OUT THERE AND WHOSE AIRSPACE WAS HE IN? ZBW SAID THAT HE WASN'T SURE WHOSE AIRSPACE (BOS OR MHT) THE DO-228 WAS IN (IT WAS AROUND THE 20 DME). THE SAAB CREW THEN STATED THAT IT WAS CLOSE. TO MAKE A SIMPLE STORY; WE CROSSED EACH OTHER'S PATH AT THE SAME ALT. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IN A COUPLE OF WAYS: MHT ATC KNEW HE HAD 2 ACFT ON THE SAME HDG LNDG AT THE SAME ARPT. WHEN HE HANDED THE DO-228 OFF TO ZBW; HE SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED HIM (BOS) ABOUT THE SAAB WHICH IS BEHIND THE DO-228 THAT IS ON THE SAME HDG AND IS MUCH FASTER. HOW ABOUT A HDG CHANGE OR A SPD REDUCTION FOR THE SAAB? THE SABB CREW EITHER NEVER SAW US OR FAILED TO MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT WITH US (DO-228). THIS HAPPENED IN A TRANSITION PERIOD (HDOF). I FEEL THAT THE SAAB CREW WAS UNPROFESSIONAL OVER THE RADIO.

AFTER TWR REMINDED HIM THAT HE WAS TO RPT L DOWNWIND; HE WAS TOLD TO CONTINUE; HOWEVER; HE PROCEEDED TO GO FROM R DOWNWIND TO L DOWNWIND OVER THE DEP END OF RWY 33 AND ABOVE ME!' NOTING THIS; I LEVELED OFF AT 300 FT MSL AND TURNED L TO AVOID ANY CONFLICT. KEPT THE TWIN CESSNA VISUAL CONTACT AND PROCEEDED WITH MY CLB WHEN TFC WAS NO LONGER A FACTOR.

UPON MY RETURN TO MVY A COUPLE OF HRS LATER; SAME CTLR (NOW WORKING GND) ASKED IF I SAW THE TWIN CESSNA. MY REPLY WAS YES AND THAT I TURNED TO AVOID HIM AND THAT HE WAS A REAL 'WINNER.'

264,3000,15,IT WAS A CLR; MOONLESS AND VERY DARK NIGHT WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY. I WAS FLYING OVER THE WATER; JUST W OF GROTON ARPT. THIS PART OF CT IS RURAL; WITH NOT VERY MANY LIGHTS. AS A RESULT MY EYES HAD ADJUSTED TO THE DARKNESS SUCH THAT I HAD TO TURN THE PANEL LIGHTS WAY DOWN. I WAS ABOUT 20 MI FROM MY HOME ARPT AT 5500 FT WHEN I LISTENED TO THE ATIS AND CALLED GROTON ARPT. AT ABOUT 15 MI OUT A STARTED A DSCNT. I NOTICED ANOTHER PLANE DIRECTLY AHEAD OF ME; STROBES FLASHING; WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO GROTON. I JUDGED THAT THIS PLANE WAS AT ABOUT 3000 OR 3500 FT. IT SEEMED TO BE TRAVELING ONLY SLIGHTLY SLOWER; SO I PLANNED TO DSND BEHIND HIM AND GO UNDER HIM IF NEED BE TO REACH PATTERN ALT. ON DSCNT; THE PLANE SEEMED TO BE GETTING SOMEWHAT NEARER; BUT IT STILL LOOKED TO BE MANY MI AHEAD. I ASSUMED THE PLANE WAS TRAVELING ONLY SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN ME. IT SEEMED THAT IN A MATTER OF A MIN OR 2 I WOULD BE WELL BELOW HIM; AT PATTERN ALT; AND COULD PASS WELL UNDER HIM. ALL OF A SUDDEN AT 9.5 DME FROM GROTON; THE PLANE CALLED THE TWR TO REQUEST TRANSITION THROUGH THE AIRSPACE; WHICH WAS GRANTED. HE SAID HE ALSO WAS 9 MI OUT AND HE WAS A HELI. I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A PROB. MY EYES WERE TELLING ME HE WAS STILL MI AHEAD OF ME; YET HIS POS RPT INDICATED HE WAS FAR CLOSER TO ME THAN I HAD THOUGHT. FURTHERMORE; I ALSO REALIZED THAT; BEING A HELI; HE PROBABLY WAS GOING SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER THAN I HAD THOUGHT; AND THAT OUR CLOSURE SPD WAS DRAMATICALLY HIGHER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED SINCE I WAS DSNDING AT 170-180 KTS. I HAD PLANNED TO REACH HIS ALT MANY MI BEHIND HIM AND PASS WELL UNDERNEATH. INSTEAD I WAS MUCH CLOSER; POSSIBLY ONLY 1/2 MI AWAY; AND CLOSING IN FAR MORE RAPIDLY THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED. AT A CLOSURE RATE OF 60-80 KTS; THE HALF MI BTWN US WOULD DISAPPEAR IN 20 SECONDS OR SO. I DECIDED TO INCREASE MY RATE OF DSCNT AND FLY UNDER HIM. I DID NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY SHARP TURNS OR ALT EXCURSIONS WHICH MIGHT RESULT IN LOSS OF CTL FOR EITHER OF THE ACFT. I PASSED UNDER THE HELI ABOUT 100-200 FT; AND ON HIS L SIDE; WHICH SCARED BOTH OF US. THE OTHER PLT CORRECTLY WAS VERY ANNOYED; I APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY. I BELIEVE MY COMPLETE MISJUDGEMENT OF THE DISTANCE BTWN US MIGHT HAVE RESULTED FROM THE INITIAL ASSUMPTION; THAT HE WAS AN AIRPLANE TRAVELING AT ABOUT MY SPD. I ALSO KEPT LOOKING AT THE STROBES; AND THE DISTANCE BTWN THEM; AND ASSUMING ALL THE TIME IT WAS AN AIRPLANE; JUDGED THE OTHER ACFT TO BE MUCH FARTHER IN FRONT THAN IT WAS. INSTEAD; IT WAS A HELI; WITH STROBES ONLY 5 FT APART; NOT 35 FT AS IN MOST SMALL AIRPLANES. THIS CREATED AN OPTICAL ILLUSION AND CONVINCED ME I WAS MANY MI BEHIND HIM; AND WOULD CLR HIM ON MY DSCNT BY 1000 FT; NOT 100 FT. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE CALLED THE TWR 9 MI OUT AND I WAS 9.5 DME.,plt OF AN sma sel overtook pass anoth acft ON wrong side result IN A nmac . IT wa A clr ; moonless veri dark night excel visibl .

I notic anoth plane directli ahead OF ME ; strobe flash ; which I thought wa go TO groton . I judg that thi plane wa AT about 3000 OR 3500 FT .

I HAD DEPARTED MY HOME BASE AT LEDGEDALE (BROCKPORT; NY) I WAS TRACKING OUTBOUND FROM KINGSTON VOR AND HAD CITY OF BRIDGEPORT IN SIGHT ABOUT 20 MI OUT. HOWEVER THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD BEEN TO BRIDGEPORT AND I APPARENTLY GOT DISORIENTED. I WAS ADVISED TO RPT MID-DOWNWIND ON RWY 29R. I HAD DRIFTED TOO FAR S OVER THE CITY AND GOT DOWNWIND ON RWY 24; WHICH I RPTED TO BRIDGEPORT TWR.

267,1600,18,AT APPROX XA15 EST WE WERE CLRED FOR AN APCH FOR RWY 05L AT PVD; RI. WX AT THE FIELD WAS RPTED 1500 FT OVCST WITH VISIBILITY AT 4 MI AND LIGHT RAIN AND FOG. THE WIND WAS RPTED AS 28 KTS GUSTING 36 KTS WITH PEAK WINDS OF 50 PLUS; AND MODERATE TURB RPTED ON FINAL APCH. THE FO WAS FLYING. AFTER RECEIVING THE ATIS INFO THE FO AND I DISCUSSED THE WX AND CONDITIONS AND DECIDED THAT I WOULD FLY THE APCH. I QUERIED APCH CTL AND WAS INFORMED THAT ACFT WERE LNDG AT PVD. I REQUESTED THAT; IN THE EVENT OF A MISSED APCH THAT WE BE CLRED STRAIGHT AHEAD TO 10000 FT MSL. WE WERE CLRED TO 6000 FT IN THE EVENT OF A MISSED APCH AND TOLD WE COULD EXPECT 10000 FT. OUR RADAR INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT WX ON OUR FLT PATH ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME BUILDUPS IN OUR VICINITY. AT 4000 FT MSL; THE WINDS ON THE FMS INDICATED 040 DEGS 101 KTS AND ALTHOUGH THE RIDE WAS A LITTLE BUMPY; IT WAS OK. AT APPROX 24 DME WE WERE CLRED TO 2000 FT TO INTERCEPT THE GS. I REQUESTED THAT WE STAY AT 4000 FT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER BUT WAS INSTRUCTED THAT I NEEDED TO DSND AT THAT TIME. THE ACFT WAS CONFIGURED WITH SLATS AND WE WERE INDICATING 220 KIAS. I STARTED THE ACFT DOWN USING THE AUTOPLT WITH A 1000 FPM RATE OF DSCNT. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WE ENCOUNTERED 'MODERATE' TURB. PASSING THROUGH ABOUT 2500 FT MSL; I NOTICED THAT THE ACFT WAS DSNDING IN EXCESS OF 2000 FPM AND WOULD NOT CATCH THE 2000 FT MSL ALT. ABOUT THAT TIME THE 'WIND SHEAR' WARNING ACTUATED AND THE ACFT DSNDED TO APPROX 1600 FT MSL. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND APPLIED PWR -- WE BEGAN TO CLB RAPIDLY. I ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING MISSED APCH AND ASKED THAT THE FO RELAY THAT TO DEP CTL. PASSING THROUGH ABOUT 3000 FT MSL; THE TCASII ANNOUNCED TFC AT ABOUT OUR 11:30 POS HIGH AND COMMANDED A DSCNT. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED UP AND SAW 2 LIGHTS SLIGHTLY L OF OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS. I WENT INTO AN IMMEDIATE HARD R TURN AND PUSHED THE NOSE OF THE ACFT OVER. SOMEWHERE DURING THIS MANEUVER THE 'WINDSHEAR' WARNING SOUNDED AGAIN AS DID THE 'SLATS OVERSPD' WARNING. OUR JUMPSEAT RIDER TOLD ME TO WATCH MY ATTITUDE. WE WERE IN A 70 DEG R BANK TURN WITH A 5 DEGS NOSE LOW ATTITUDE PASSING A LITTLE BELOW 3000 FT MSL AT APPROX 300 KIAS. SOMETIME DURING ALL OF THIS THE CTLR WAS ASKING WHERE WE WERE GOING; ANNOUNCING THE TFC; AND TELLING US TO LEVEL OFF AT 3000 FT MSL. AFTER THE SIT WAS UNDER CTL WE WERE ASKED OUR INTENTIONS. WE STATED THAT WE WISHED TO PROCEED TO OUR ALTERNATE BANGOR; ME. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH FLT CTL; WE PROCEEDED TO BDL. I TALKED WITH APCH CTL AFTER THIS EVENT AND ASKED WHY THERE WAS AN AIRPLANE 2000 FT ABOVE ME ON THE SAME APCH COURSE. I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AT A HIGHER SPD THAT I SHOULD HAVE PASSED AHEAD OF HIM BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DSCNT AND THAT THE CTLR DID NOT EXPECT ME TO GAR AT 18 MI FROM THE FIELD.

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE VIGILANT CONSIDERING I WAS IN AN AIRWAY. I WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH ATC; AND WAS NOT MONITORING THEIR FREQ AS I NORMALLY DO. EITHER STEP COULD HAVE GIVEN ME A WARNING OF TFC.

271,4500,13,I WAS ENRTE FROM PLYMOUTH; MA; TO WESTERLY; RI; WITH A STUDENT ON A XCOUNTRY FLT; LEVEL AT 4500 FT MSL; WITH ALL EQUIP WORKING ON TKOF. ABOUT 20 NM E OF PROVIDENCE; RI; I CALLED PVD APCH TO OBTAIN FLT FOLLOWING. THE CTLR GAVE ME A XPONDER CODE AND TOLD ME TO IDENT. I SQUAWKED THE CODE AND PUSHED THE INDENT BUTTON. THEN I WENT BACK TO GIVING INSTRUCTION TO MY STUDENT. AROUND 5-6 MINS LATER; IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I DID NOT HEAR THE CTLR VERIFY THAT I WAS RADAR CONTACT. SO I CALLED APCH CTL AGAIN AND ASKED TO VERIFY THAT I WAS IN RADAR CONTACT. BY NOW; I WAS OVER PVD CLASS C AIRSPACE LEVEL 4500 FT MSL AND ABOUT 7 NM SE OF PVD ARPT. THE CTLR CAME BACK AND TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO SECONDARY OR PRIMARY RETURN ON THE RADAR SCOPE AND TO REMAIN CLR OF PVD CLASS C AIRSPACE. NOW; I WAS ABOUT 2 NM S OF QUONSET STATE ARPT AND I ELECTED TO CONTINUE ON COURSE; FIGURING IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME DISTANCE TO CONTINUE STRAIGHT AHEAD THAN TURNING L TO GET BEYOND THE 10 MI RING OF THE CLASS C AIRSPACE; BEING THAT I NOW DID NOT HAVE AN OPERABLE MODE C XPONDER. CONTINUING ENRTE; ABOUT 6 NM SW OF QUONSET ARPT; TFC WAS SPOTTED AT 12 O'CLOCK AT THE SAME ALT AS MY ACFT. I WAS FORCED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION BY BANKING TO THE R AND DSNDING 300 FT WHEN A DC-9 FLEW DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE DC-9 WAS AT 4500 FT MSL (WHICH WAS MY VFR ALT FLYING WBOUND) AND HE WAS TRAVELLING EBOUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THE DC-9 PLT EVER SAW ME; BECAUSE HE DID NOT SEEM TO TAKE ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WHEN AN ACFT LOSES ITS MODE C XPONDER AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY LOSE IT OVER CLASS C OR B AIRSPACE; THAT THE CTLR DOES NOT JUST HASTILY KICK ACFT OUT OF THE AIRSPACE; BUT MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP UP POS RPTING TO REDUCE THE POSSIBILITIES OF CLOSE CALLS LIKE THIS ONE. FURTHERMORE; UNLESS THE DC- 9 WAS DSNDING; HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FLYING ON A WBOUND VFR ALT WHEN FLYING EBOUND. AS SHOWN HERE; IT JUST INCREASES THE POSSIBILITY (ALTHOUGH REMOTE) OF A MIDAIR COLLISION.,sma ha nmac dc9 .

273,1000,10,SHORTLY AFTER TKOF FROM BDL ENRTE TO PIT; WE WERE HANDED OFF TO ZBW. CLRNC WAS DIRECT TO CTR VOR. AT 11000 FT; WE WERE ADVISED OF TURBOPROP TFC AT '12000 FT; 1-2 O'CLOCK; APPROX 8 MI.' WE ACQUIRED THE TFC VISUALLY AND VIA TCASII AT 2 O'CLOCK AND ADVISED ATC. AT THIS POINT; ZBW ISSUED THESE INSTRUCTIONS: 'MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION WITH THAT TFC; CLB AND MAINTAIN 17000 FT; NO DELAY THROUGH 13000 FT.' AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THIS CLRNC; THE FO AND I DETERMINED BY VISUAL REFS AND THE TCASII THAT WE COULD INITIATE A QUICK CLB AND MAINTAIN SEPARATION; ALTHOUGH THE TFC WAS TRACKING STRAIGHT DOWN THE 2 O'CLOCK LINE OF THE TCASII. AFTER INITIATING THE CLB; THE TCASII ISSUED A TA; WHEREUPON THE FO; FLYING THE PLANE; INCREASED THE CLB RATE. THE TA WAS FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY AN INSISTENT RA ('DSND! DSND NOW!). SINCE WE WERE ALREADY COMMITTED TO A HIGH RATE OF CLB AT APPROX 20 DEG DECK ANGLE AND 5000 FPM RATE OF CLB AND TRADING AIRSPD FOR ALT FROM THE INITIAL 310 KTS; WE CONTINUED THE CLB AND MADE A CLRING TURN OF ABOUT 30 DEGS TO THE L OF OUR RTE CLRNC. FROM THE TCASII WE CONCLUDED THAT WE PASSED 12000 FT; THE TARGET'S ALT; AT APPROX 3.5 NM RANGE; AND CLRED 13000 FT AT ABOUT 3.0 NM RANGE. AIRSPD AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EVASIVE MANEUVER WAS 230 KTS. THE OTHER TFC MADE NO APPARENT CHANGE IN FLT PATH OR ALT. THE TFC PASSED ALMOST DIRECTLY BELOW US. 1) ZBW WAS REMISS IN ISSUING THESE CLB INSTRUCTIONS -- THIS IS A TECHNIQUE ALLOWED FOR APCH/DEP CTL BUT NOT FOR ARTCC. 2) WE WERE MISTAKEN IN ACCEPTING THIS CLRNC; AND THEN IN INITIATING THE CLB WHICH RESULTED IN REDUCED SEPARATION. 3) IT IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS TO DISREGARD A TCASII RA; BUT UNDER VISUAL CONDITIONS WE WERE MORE COMFORTABLE DOING THIS THAN ATTEMPTING TO TRANSITION FROM A 5000 FPM CLB TO A 3000 FPM DSCNT. THE BIG PROB POTENTIAL IS THAT THE OTHER TFC WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED A 'CLB' RA WHICH WOULD HAVE FURTHER REDUCED SEPARATION. PRESUMABLY; THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE OTHER TFC HAD BEEN TCASII-EQUIPPED WITHOUT A VISUAL CONTACT ON US. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 298009: WE WERE LEVEL AT 11000 FT NWBOUND ABOUT 10 NM SE OF CTR; AWAITING CLB CLRNC FROM CTR. CTR CALLS OUT TFC AT 2 O'CLOCK AND LEVEL AT 12000 FT WBOUND; I DON'T RECALL THE DISTANCE. WE ADVISED CTR WE HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT. CTR HESITATES FOR A MOMENT AND SAYS TO CLB TO 17000 FT AND NO DELAY THROUGH 13000 FT. WE CHK THE TFC; AND IT'S 6 MI NOW. WE BOTH FELT COMFORTABLE THAT IF WE EXPEDITED THE CLB; IT SHOULD BE NO PROB. I IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED CWS ON THE AUTOPLT AND STARTED A 5000-6000 FPM CLB. IMMEDIATELY AFTER I INITIATED THE CLB; TCASII DISPLAYED A TA ALERT. SOON AFTER; TCASII DISPLAYED AN RA; COMMANDING A DSCNT. SINCE I HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT; I KEPT THE ACFT CLBING THROUGH 12500 FT. WHILE TURNING L (WBOUND) TO GET MORE SPACING. I SAW THE COMMUTER TURBOPROP PASS BENEATH US AT ABOUT 13000 FT. THIS SIT WAS ONE OF THOSE LIVE AND LEARN AND TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. I'M NEVER GOING TO ACCEPT A CLRNC LIKE THAT AGAIN. I'M JUST GOING TO ADVISE THAT WE'LL WAIT FOR TFC TO CLR WHETHER WE HAVE THE TFC IN SIGHT OR NOT.

276,43000,113,I WAS WORKING RADAR POS R86 AND R65 AT NEW YORK ARTCC. AT APPROX XX30Z I WAS WORKING AN HVT FLT EBOUND FROM JFK; THE FLT WAS CLBING TO FL550 B600. I WAS ALSO WORKING A GULSTREAM; G4; FLYING FROM ACK LACKS FLANN A523 TO DEST. WHEN THE ACFT WERE APPROX 100 MI APART I OBSERVED THAT BOTH ACFT WERE AT FL430. I BELIEVED THAT THE ACFT WOULD CROSS IN THE VICINITY OF LACKS INTXN AND THAT I WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ALT SEPARATION. I WAS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL COMPLEX SITS WITH OTHER ACFT. WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THIS SIT I HAD APPROX 60 MI BTWN THE ACFT WITH THE HVT CLBING OUT OF FL440. I ASKED IF THE HVT WOULD BE OUT OF FL450 WITHIN THE NEXT 40 MI. HE SAID 'YES.' AGAIN; I WAS DISTRACTED WITH ANOTHER SIT WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THE CONCORD THE FLT WAS AT FL443 AND APPROX 25 MI FROM THE G4. I AGAIN ASKED THE FLT IF HE WOULD BE OUT OF FL450. AT THIS TIME HE STATED THAT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED A TEMP INVERSION AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CLB. THE HVT PLT WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE TEMP INVERSION AND I WAS UNABLE TO BROADCAST ON THE FREQ TO DSND THE G4. I HAD A HALO ON THE G4 AND IT WAS OBVIOUS NOW THAT THE TARGETS WERE GOING TO MERGE. WHEN THE HVT FINISHED I IMMEDIATELY DSNDED THE G4 AND CALLED TFC TO THE FLT. AS THE HVT ENTERED THE HALO HE WAS SHOWING FL443 I ASKED THE G4 TO CONFIRM OUT OF FL420 AND HE CONCURRED. THE PLT OF THE G4 THEN STATED THAT HE HAD JUST FLOWN THROUGH THE SONIC BOOM OF THE HVT AND THAT IT HAD BEEN A VERY UNPLEASANT SIT TO BE IN. WITH THE SPDS INVOLVED AND THE RATES OF CLB THE RADAR SNITCH DID NOT ACTIVATE. HOWEVER; I BELIEVE THAT THE ACFT PASSED WITHIN 1400 FT OF EACH OTHER. THE HVT WAS ACCELERATING TO MACH 2 AT THE TIME. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER ENCOUNTERED A SIT WHERE THE HVT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE HIS CLB. NORMALLY THE HVT IS OUT OF FL470 AT THE POINT WHERE THESE ACFT PASSED. ALTHOUGH I IDENTED THE SIT EARLY I DID NOT TAKE POSITIVE CTL OF THE SIT TO ENSURE SEPARATION OF THE ACFT. I HAD SEVERAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE FROM STOPPING THE G4 AT A LOWER ALT INITIALLY OR VECTORING THE ACFT TO PLACE THE HVT BEHIND THE G4.

278,7700,16,WHILE IN A CRUISE CLB IN A BE-58 BARRON; AUTOPLT ENGAGED; 140 KTS; 800-1000 FPM ON A 240 DEG HDG. (WHICH AT THE TIME PUT THE SUN AT 12 O'CLOCK AND ABOUT 20 DEGS ABOVE THE HORIZON). AT THE TIME NHZ APCH WAS WORKING A P3 WITH AN ENG OUT ON A PAR APCH ALONG WITH OTHER IFR AND VFR ACFT. THE CTLR ISSUED TFC TO ME 'TFC 12 TO 1 O'CLOCK; 1 MI OPPOSITE DIRECTION; ALT INDICATES 7700 FT.' (THEY WERE NOT TALKING TO HIM) I LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION; SAW NOTHING BUT SUN; DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT; THEN SAW THE ACFT; A PAZT. (I WAS CLBING THROUGH 7500 FT WHEN THE TFC WAS ISSUED) THE PAZT WAS AT 12 O'CLOCK ABOUT 1/4 MI OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN MY ACFT. I APPLIED QUITE A BIT OF NOSE DOWN AND R AILERON TO AVOID THE PAZT. THE ACFT PASSED OVER MY NOSE AND L WING WITH ABOUT 30-40 FT OF VERT SEPARATION. THE AZTEC MADE NO APPARENT MOVE AND APPEARED TO BE IN LEVEL CRUISE. I THEN CONTINUED MY CLB TO 8000 FT. FROM THE TIME THE TFC WAS ISSUED TO THE TIME OF THE EVENT WAS NO MORE THAN 10-15 SECONDS. PRIOR TO THE EVENT; EVERYTHING (NAV; AUTOPLT; RADIOS; ETC.) IN MY ACFT WAS SET; AND MY FOCUS WAS OUTSIDE THE ACFT LOOKING FOR TFC. THE SUN WAS A GREAT RESTR TO MY VISIBILITY AND THE TFC WAS CTRED IN THE SUN. I ASKED THE CTLR WHY THE TFC WASN'T CALLED SOONER; THE RESPONSE WAS WE WERE BUSY AND HE JUST 'POPPED-UP.' NO CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE AZTEC. IN MY OPINION; THE CTLR WAS SPREAD TOO THIN; WITH THE P-3 PAR APCH AND THE OTHER TFC IN THE AREA. 90 PERCENT OF HIS XMISSIONS WERE TO THE P-3. IF A FINAL CTLR WERE USED TO RUN THE PAR; TFC WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED EARLIER AND THE EVENT AVOIDED.,nmac - plt clbing into sun ha tfc point out ; but doe not see IT until last moment .

I ANNOUNCE TFC TO PF; HE SEES TFC AND INITIATES A CLB. AS I REACH FOR THE MIKE TO ADVISE ATC OF THE TFC AND OUR CLB; OTHER PLT SAYS 'TELL HIM WE'RE CLBING TO A TCASII COMMAND.' I TELL ATC 'XXX CLBING FOR TCASII TFC.' THIS ALL HAPPENED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY. ATC SAYS 'I DON'T SEE ANY TFC OUT THERE' AND 'YOU HAVE SAAB TFC ABOVE YOU AT 4000 FT.' WE KNEW; AND HAD SEEN; THE SAAB. HE WAS AT 4000 FT; BUT ALSO WAS BEHIND US. ATC THEN ASKED SAAB; 'DO YOU SHOW TCASII TFC AT 3000 FT?' SAAB SAID NO. BY NOW WE HAVE PASSED OVER TFC AND STARTED TO DSND. THE HIGHEST WE GOT WAS 3600 FT MSL BRIEFLY. AS WE DSND THROUGH 3400 FT; ATC SAYS HE SAW NO TFC; THAT WE HAD IFR TFC (THE SAAB) AT 4000 FT. THAT HE WOULD WRITE UP OUR ALTDEV; THEN SAYS CLB TO 9000 FT. WE PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY. NOW THAT THINGS HAD CALMED DOWN; WE REALIZED WE DID NOT GET A TCASII COMMAND! ATC AND THE SAAB DID NOT 'SEE' HIM BECAUSE HE DID NOT USE A XPONDER! WE HAVE HAD TCASII ABOUT 2 YRS. IT IS A GREAT TOOL. OPERATING IN THE NE; WE GET OCCASIONAL RA'S. WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO TCASII CALLOUTS. THAT IS WHY I INCORRECTLY USED 'CLBING FOR TCASII COMMAND.' THE TFC WAS THERE; AND I BELIEVE A MIDAIR COLLISION MAY HAVE OCCURRED HAD WE NOT TAKEN EVASIVE ACTION. WE DID THE RIGHT THING. WE ARE ALIVE. OUR ERROR; IN THE INTENSITY OF THE EVENT; WAS INCORRECT TERMINOLOGY OF OUR ACTIONS; AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT TCASII WAS 'CALLING.' TCASII IS A GREAT TOOL; BUT SCANNING WILL STILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THIS FLC WAS FLYING A CORPORATE CITATION III AND THEIR PRIMARY PROB IN THIS EVENT IS THAT THEY IMPROPERLY USED THE TERMINOLOGY TCASII INSTEAD OF AVOIDING TFC IN SIGHT. SINCE THE CTLR DID NOT SEE THE INTRUDER ON HIS SCOPE; HE ASSUMED THAT IT WAS NOT THERE WHEN THE FLC USED THE IMPROPER TERMINOLOGY. THE FLC RECOGNIZES THEIR ERROR; BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY THINK THAT THE CTLR WAS A BIT TOO AGGRESSIVE TOWARD THEM. THEY HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE FAA.

291,500,12,DURING A BANNER TOW OP OVER THE OCEAN ON CAPE COD; MY ACFT TOWING A 30 FT BY 100 FT BILLBOARD WAS INVOLVED IN A COLLISION WITH MY BOSS'S ACFT. THE VISIBILITY WAS POOR AND DETERIORATING IN HAZE AND FOG. I WAS THE LEAD ACFT WITH MY BOSS APPROX 1 MI IN TRAIL. WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO TERMINATE THE TOW ON THE S SIDE OF THE CAPE AND CLB UP TO 1000 FT AND GET VECTORS TO THE N SIDE OF THE CAPE TO GET AS MUCH OF OUR ORIGINAL RTE DONE AS POSSIBLE. AFTER PASSING ONE PARTICULAR BEACH; I WAS TO TURN R OUT OVER THE OCEAN; THEN TURN L OVER LAND (VISIBILITY WAS BETTER 1/4 - 1/2 MI INLAND). I ENTERED A FOG BANK HIDDEN BY THE HAZE. AT THAT POINT I LOST ALL OUTSIDE VISUAL REFS. WHILE STRUGGLING TO STAY UPRIGHT DUE TO VERY LIMITED INSTRUMENTATION IN A PA-25; I CALLED MY BOSS TO TELL HIM I HAD LOST ALL IDEA OF MY LOCATION. I CONTINUED MY R TURN TO GET BACK OUT OF THE FOG. I DID NOT REGAIN ANY VISUAL REFS UNTIL I WAS ON A COURSE PERPENDICULAR AND APCHING THE BEACH. I AGAIN RADIOED MY BOSS TO TELL HIM THAT I WAS COMING BACK AT THE BEACH WHICH WAS NOT WHAT HE EXPECTED ME TO DO. I WENT TO FULL PWR TRYING TO CLB ABOVE HIS EXPECTED FLT PATH. AT THAT POINT HIS ACFT COLLIDED WITH MY BANNER. TWO ROPE HOOKS AND A BANNER WERE TAKEN OFF MY ACFT. THE BILLBOARD IMPACTED THE C-172'S R WING AND SHREDDED INTO 2 PIECES; 1 ABOVE AND BELOW THE WING. HE DROPPED HIS BANNER TO LIGHTEN HIS DRAG LOAD. HE WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT AND MADE A FORCED LNDG ON AN UNOCCUPIED PART OF THE BEACH WITH NO INJURIES OR MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE ACFT. I WAS PRESSURED TO CONTINUE WHEN I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FORCEFUL ABOUT TURNING BACK EARLIER. I SHOULD HAVE CLBED ABOVE 500 FT AND TURNED L TOWARD BETTER VISIBILITY AND GREATER DEFINITION BTWN LAND AND SKY. NEEDED BETTER RADIO COM AND COORD. HE NEVER HEARD THE 2 IMPORTANT CALLS.

292,15500,25,WE WERE RECEIVING VFR ADVISORIES. CTR POINTED OUT A B747 AT 10 O'CLOCK AND WE BEGAN TO SCAN IN THAT DIRECTION. HE WAS IFR AT 16000 FT AND OUR FLT PATHS WOULD HAVE TAKEN US DIRECTLY THROUGH HIS WAKE. WHILE WE HAD HIM VISUALLY; WE ELECTED TO INITIATE AN IMMEDIATE CLB ABOVE HIS FLT PATH TO 16500 FT. WE MAINTAINED VISUAL SEPARATION FROM THE B747; BUT APPARENTLY HE GOT A TCASII ADVISORY BECAUSE OF OUR DECISION TO CLB AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD TO WRITE UP THE INCIDENT. HE SAID HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A NEAR MISS; BUT BECAUSE OF THE COCKPIT RECORDER WOULD HAVE TO FILE PAPERS WITH HIS COMPANY. THE B747 PLT THOUGHT WE PASSED UNNECESSARILY CLOSE. I THINK; BEING THAT WE WERE VFR AND HE WAS IFR; CENTER SHOULD HAVE VECTORED HIM AWAY FROM OUR FLT PATH; BEING WE INITIALLY HAD ONLY 500 FT SEP AND HE WAS A HVY JET. AT THE TIME WE FELT IT BETTER TO CLB THROUGH HIS ALT BEING WE WERE BOTH OPERATING IN VMC; THAN PASS DIRECTLY THROUGH HIS WAKE. POSSIBLY CTR COULD HAVE SUGGESTED A HDG TO PREVENT US FROM PASSING SO CLOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE. OUR FIRST TFC ADVISORY WAS TOO LATE FOR US TO ALTER COURSE WITHOUT MAKING AN EXCESSIVE BANK WITH PAX SO WE ELECTED TO CLB. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 314743: WE PICKED HIM UP (TRAVELING WBOUND INTO THE SUN) AND IMMEDIATELY CLBED TO ABOUT 16700 FT ABOVE HIM USING NORMAL MANEUVERS CLBING ABOUT 1500 TO 2000 FPM. ACFT 2 WAS IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES AND WE ESTIMATED HIM TO GET TO WITHIN 1 TO 1.5 MI FROM US AT THE CLOSEST POINT. I CALLED ZBW WHEN I GOT ON THE GND AND TALKED TO A SUPVR. HE DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS ANY CONFLICT NOR DID THE ACTING CTLR; WHILE WE WERE FLYING; STATE IT WAS A NEAR MISS. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO CLB UP AND OVER AND BACK BEHIND THE B747 TO 15500 FT INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH WAKE TURB AVOIDANCE.,corp king clb through occupi alt after tfc advisori given .

294,2000,1,DEP INSTRUCTIONS WERE RWY HDG TO 2000 FT. JUST AFTER TKOF; TWR ALERTED US TO TFC AT OUR 10 O'CLOCK; DIRECTED A TURN TO A HDG OF 010 DEGS; AND INSTRUCTED US TO CHANGE TO THE APCH FREQ. THIS INTERRUPTED OUR AFTER TKOF FLOW; INCLUDING OUR '1000 FT TO GO' CALLOUT. AT THE SAME TIME; OUR TCASII GAVE US BOTH A VISUAL AND AURAL TA; WITH THE TFC IN QUESTION AT OUR 10-12 O'CLOCK; AT THE ALT THROUGH WHICH WE WERE PASSING AND SHOWING VERY CLOSE; ALMOST ON TOP OF; OUR CURRENT POS. BOTH OF US PLTS RESPONDED TO THE TA; LOOKING INSIDE AT THE TCASII SCREEN AS WELL AS OUTSIDE FOR THE TFC WHILE I WAS TURNING TO THE NEWLY ASSIGNED HDG. MEANWHILE; WE CONTINUED TO CLB AT TKOF PWR AND 200 KIAS IN THE ATA. AS WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS THROUGH 2000 FT; THE PNF ALERTED ME WITH A CALLOUT. IN AN EFFORT TO NOT OVER-CONTROL THE LEVEL OFF FROM OUR CLB RATE OF 4000-5000 FPM; I REDUCED PWR STEADILY BUT NOT QUICKLY; AND PUSHED THE NOSE OVER; DSNDING BACK TO 2000 FT. AT OUR HIGHEST POINT; WE REACHED 750 FT ABOVE OUR ASSIGNED ALT. I BELIEVE THIS EXCURSION WAS CAUSED BY (1) THE INTERRUPTION OF OUR AFTER TKOF FLOW AND CALLOUTS; ESPECIALLY THE '1000 FT TO GO' CALLOUT; (2) THE ATTEMPT BY BOTH PLTS TO ANALYZE THE TCASII ALERT IN ORDER TO LOCATE AND AVOID THE TFC; AND (3) DIVERSION OF ATTN AS PF FROM MAINTAINING ASSIGNED HDGS; ALTS; AND AIRSPDS. INTERRUPTIONS FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES ARE A GIVEN IN THE COURSE OF ANY FLT AND CANNOT BE PREVENTED BY THE CREW; SO I CANNOT RECOMMEND A CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR THAT. FOR THE OTHER TWO FACTORS; CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONAL PROCS ARE POSSIBLE TO MINIMIZE CHANCES OF A RECURRENCE. ON FUTURE FLTS UNDER IFR; WE WILL NOT OPERATE THE TCASII IN THE TERMINAL AREA DURING DEP; BUT INSTEAD RELY UPON ATC AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST TO KEEP US CLR AS WE FLY ASSIGNED HDGS AND ALTS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE TCASII ALERTS OUR ATTN WITHOUT DEGRADATION TO OUR FLT PARAMETERS. DURING VFR DEPS WHERE WE ARE NOT ARTIFICIALLY LIMITED TO A LOW INITIAL LEVEL OFF ALT OR A SPECIFIC HDG AND MAY NOT HAVE THE FULL ASSISTANCE OF ATC; WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE TCASII FOR COLLISION AVOIDANCE. AS PF; I WILL NOT PERMIT MY ATTN TO BE DIVERTED FROM HDG; ALT; OR AIRSPD UNTIL AT LEAST THE ACFT IS STABILIZED AT INITIAL CRUISE.

I LOOKED OVER MY INSTRUCTOR'S SHOULDER FOR TFC AND SAW NOTHING SO WE STARTED A 20 DEG BANKED; CLBING TURN TO THE L (360 DEGS). AS WE REACHED THE 180 DEG POINT; THE SUN WAS STRAIGHT OFF THE NOSE AND I COULDN'T SEE OUTSIDE; BUT STRAINED TO SEE IF ANY TFC WAS OUT THERE; AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO CORRECT THE SIMULATED ERRORS THAT MY INSTRUCTOR WAS GIVING ME. WE WERE PASSING THROUGH 4000 FT NOW AND JUST BEFORE WE LEVELED OFF; I SAW THE ATR-42 PASS ABOVE THE ACFT AT NO LESS THAN 400 FT VERTICALLY. I ALERTED MY FLT INSTRUCTOR AND SHAKEN; I DECIDED TO END THE LESSON AND RETURN TO THE ARPT. LATER I REALIZED THAT THE ATR'S FLT PATH WAS COMING FROM THE SAME DIRECTION THAT THE SUN WAS COMING FROM AT THE 180 DEG POINT OF OUR TURN; AND THAT; UNFORTUNATELY; IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE THE ACFT AGAINST THE SUN.

WHEN I CONTACTED DEP; I MISSTATED THAT WE WERE CLBING TO 5000 FT. WHILE CORRECTING MY FO TO LEVELOFF AT 4000 FT; THE CTLR GAVE US A 5 DEG TURN TO THE R TO AVOID A CONFLICT WITH THE OTHER TFC.

308,10000,40,FLT PLANNED AT FL250 TO MHT. DURING DSCNT I WAS PNF AND HAD ACQUIRED ATIS FOR MHT. AS PER THE CHKLIST ALL THE ATIS ITEMS WERE BRIEFED; AND AS I READ OFF THE ALTIMETER TO THE FO (PF) I HELD UP AND POINTED TO THE ATIS NUMBER AND ALTIMETER READING '29.64.' HE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER; REPEATED IT AND I WATCHED HIM DIAL IT IN; AS I DIALED IT INTO MY 2 ALTIMETERS (NORMAL AND STANDBY). THE CTLR WANTED A RAPID RATE OF DSCNT. WE OBLIGED WITH 3000 FPM. I CAUTIONED THE FO THAT THE AUTOPLT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DISREGARD THE ALT PRESELECTED AND PENETRATE SET ALTS. NOT JUST THIS ACFT; PROB IS FLEETWIDE. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AND WAS READY FOR IT. THE ASSIGNED ALT WAS TO BE 11000 FT. AT 13000 FT I CAUTIONED THE FO TO EXPECT CAPTURE SOON AND FAILING THAT TO DISENGAGE THE AUTOPLT AND EFFECT THE LEVEL OFF. HE SAID HE WOULD. WITH 3000 FPM DSCNT; I AGAIN STATED THIS AT 12000 FT. AND AT 11500 FT SAID; 'LEVEL OFF IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH IT!' ATC WANTS TO KNOW OUR ALT AS WE PASS THROUGH 11000 FT; AND AS I CHK HIS ALTIMETER IT READS LEVEL AT 11000 FT WHILE MINE READS 10000 FT. I IMMEDIATELY ASK FOR A CURRENT ALTIMETER SETTING AND SELECT TCASII DISPLAY WHILE THE CTLR TELLS US TO CLB IMMEDIATELY TO 11000 FT. HE ALSO GIVES TFC A 30 DEG TURN TO AVOID US. I FOUND THE TFC AT 7-6 MI; 1-2 MI HIGHER; AND LATER CLOSEST PASS WAS 2 - 2 1/2 AND SEVERAL HUNDRED VERT. I CHKED ALL 3 ALTIMETERS. MY 2 WERE CORRECTLY SET. HIS WAS INCORRECTLY SET TO 30.46. I CHKED THE ATIS CARD; HOWEVER THE WRITING WAS CLR AND LARGE ENOUGH NOT TO CONFUSE -- NOR COULD HE EXPLAIN IT. HE WAS VERY APOLOGETIC AND IS OTHERWISE A VERY DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY CREW MEMBER. I CAN ONLY THINK HE MIGHT HAVE DIALED IN PART OF A FREQ HE HEARD DURING THE DSCNT. I WILL CHK THIS THROUGH ON FUTURE FLTS TO MHT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: THIS AIRPLANE IS DARK. DAMNED DARK! ALL OF THEM ARE! I'M CERTAIN THAT IF MORE INST/COCKPIT ILLUMINATION EXISTED THIS WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED; AND ON THE RAMP WITHOUT AN ENG RUNNING IT'S MUCH WORSE. I WOULD ALSO VOTE IN FAVOR OF AN ALTIMETER COMPARATOR WARNING SYS. IF INSTALLED IT WOULD ALERT PLTS TO THE POTENTIAL MIS- SETTING OF THEIR ALTIMETERS. WE HAVE A HDG COMPARATOR WARNING ANNUNCIATOR AND THEY DO A FINE JOB. THE HDG COMPARATOR SHOWS A 'C' IN ORANGE ON THE EAS IF HDGS DIFFER BY MORE THAN 6 DEGS TOTAL. IN THE FUTURE I'LL HAVE THE FO CALL OUT THE ATIS NUMBER FOR THE ALTIMETER INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING AN 'OK' AS CONFIRMATION THAT HE HAS CORRECTLY SET THE ALTIMETER.

309,5500,27,I WAS FLYING PITTSFIELD; MA; TO PORTLAND; ME; IN CESSNA 172 HAWK XP WITH 1 PAX. FLT PLAN; WAS FILED WITH BURLINGTON; DEPARTED PSF XA00 CLBED TO 5500 FT MSL; HEADING DIRECT TO KEENE VOR; ACTIVATED FLT PLAN; WAS LISTENING TO BRADLEY APCH; STROBES; NAV LIGHTS; AND BEACON WERE ON. VISIBILITY WAS UNLIMITED; AIR SMOOTH. AFTER REACHING ALT AND XING MOUNTAINS OUT OF BERKSHIRE VALLEY I ADJUSTED VOR DIAL TO CHK RADIAL; AND CHKED DME GETTING READY TO CALL BRADLEY FOR FLT FOLLOWING. I LOOKED OUT MY SIDE WINDOW TO SEE 3 MIL PLANES COMING TOWARD US FROM ABOUT 9 O'CLOCK AT AN ALT THAT APPEARED ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN OURS. I PUSHED IN FULL PWR AND STARTED A CLB; CALLED BRADLEY; GAVE MY POS. I HOPED THEY WOULD SEE THIS CRISIS. I DIDN'T ASK FOR HELP WITH THIS; THERE WAS NO TIME. THE PLANES PASSED BELOW US. THE FIRST 2 WERE SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF US; THE THIRD WAS DIRECTLY UNDER US. I CANNOT GIVE ANY ACCURACY TO THE CLOSENESS IN FT. I WOULD ESTIMATE 50 PLUS OR MINUS VERT. I DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH MIL ACFT; SO I CAN'T USE SIZE TO HELP DETERMINE DISTANCE. WHATEVER IT WAS; IT WAS WAY TOO CLOSE. AFTER THE PLANES HAD PASSED; BRADLEY APCH TOLD ME TO CONTACT ZBW AND SAID I WAS TOO FAR OUT FOR BRADLEY. WE CONTINUED OUR TRIP. CONTRIBUTING TO THE SIT WAS THE FACT THAT WHILE I WAS ADJUSTING INSTS I WAS MONITORING THE AIRSPACE IN FRONT OF ME BUT NOT AT MY SIDES; ALSO; I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TUNED INTO ZBW NOT BRADLEY. I WAS NOT IN A MIL OPS AREA. I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THE MIL PLANES' PLTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF OUR PLANE AND ALTERED THEIR COURSE MILES BEFORE GETTING TO US.

312,3000,15,ON A FLT FROM BUF TO JFK; A TFC CONFLICT OCCURRED WHILE ON THE PWL 1 ARR. THIS HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TIME WE COME IN ON THIS ARR AND IS MUCH WORSE ON WKENDS. OUR ALT IS TOO LOW AT 4000 FT. IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO KEEP US AT 10000 FT AND RUN US FARTHER E OVER THE WATER AND PARALLEL THE COAST ON DOWN TO JFK. THERE IS GOING TO BE A MIDAIR IF THIS ISN'T CHANGED! CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE TCASII RA; THE RPTR (CAPT) STATED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE; AND THAT HE COULD GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS SAME THING EVERY SINGLE WKEND. THE RPTR TAKES ISSUE WITH THE FACT THAT THE TFC CTL SEEMS TO CONTINUE TO BE CONDUCTED IN THE SAME MANNER; IN SPITE OF ALL THE CONFLICTS AND RELATED COMPLAINTS. (THE ARR PLAN KEEPS ALL THE COMMUTERS DOWN LOW; AT A HIGH SPD; AND MIXES THEM WITH ALL SORTS OF UNCTLED VFR TFC.) THE RPTR (PF) SAW THIS CONFLICT COMING. THE FLC'S ACFT WAS LEVEL AT 4000 FT AND THE DISPLAY WAS SHOWING THE INTRUDER AT 200-500 FT ABOVE AND BTWN 11:30 AND 12 O'CLOCK; WHEN THE RA WAS RECEIVED. THE CAPT RESPONDED; FOLLOWING THE TCASII COMMANDS DOWN TO 3000 FT. WHEN THE CTLR WAS INFORMED OF THE FLC'S EVASIVE ACTION; THE CTLR SIMPLY ACKNOWLEDGED; AS IF THIS WAS NOTHING NEW. RPTR ADDS; 'AND THIS WAS NOTHING NEW.' THIS CAPT FEELS THAT WITHOUT BETTER INFO; HE MUST RESPOND TO AN RA. IN THE WINTER MONTHS; IN WX; AND ON LOW VISIBILITY DAYS HE HAS DIFFICULTY GAINING VISUAL ACQUISITION OF TFC. THE CTLR CALLING THE TFC; OR THE OTHER ACFT HAVING OUR ACFT IN SIGHT; ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH REASONS NOT TO RESPOND TO AN RA. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 344316: I DO THIS SAME ARR 20 TIMES A MONTH. EVERY TIME I RECEIVE AT LEAST 1 TA; IF NOT MORE. THE ARR BRINGS US DOWN TO 4000 FT; ABOUT 70 MI FROM JFK (OUR DEST). WE ARE DOING 240 KIAS MIXING WITH ALL TYPES OF VFR TFC THAT IS NOT TALKING TO ANYONE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR ACN 344316 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: NOW; AN EXTRA 4 OR 5 FLTS FROM THE RPTR'S COMPANY ARE ALSO FOLLOWING THE SAME PAWLING 1 ARR AS A RESULT OF A ROUTING CHANGE. THIS RTE ADDS AN ADDITIONAL 40 MINS ON TO THE BLOCK TIME; AND WHEN FLYING IN TO JFK; THIS TAKES THE 1 HR SCHEDULED GND TIME DOWN TO ONLY 20 MINS. THE RPTR'S FLTS HAVE BEEN DEPARTING LATE BECAUSE 20 MINS IS NOT ENOUGH GND TIME AT JFK. THE PRIMARY PROB; THOUGH; IS THE CONTINUAL TFC CONFLICTS. IN 3-4 YRS OF FLYING THIS AIRSPACE; THE RPTR (FO) HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST 15 RA'S. THE CONFLICTS MOSTLY ARE A RESULT OF THE HIGH DENSITY OF VFR CORP TFC OPERATING IN THE VICINITY OF WHITE PLAINS AND LIGHT TRAINING ACFT AROUND BRIDGEPORT. RPTR BELIEVES THAT IF ATC KEPT HIM UP AT 10000 FT AND BROUGHT HIM DOWN OVER HTO TO FOLLOW THE COASTLINE IN; THAT IT WOULD SAVE FUEL; TIME; AND ABOVE ALL -- LIVES.,A commut flc rpt take evas action IN respons TO A tcasii RA that they receiv ON pawl 1 arr . flc also rpt that thi IS not AN uncommon experi becaus they are often fli AT spd close TO 250 kt IN vicin OF unctl vfr tfc ON arr rout into new york 'S class B airspac .

AFTER TURNING TO 060 DEGS I ALLOWED THE ACFT TO CLB TO 5300 FT PRIOR TO BEING ADVISED BY CTR THAT NO NEW ALT WAS ISSUED AND I SHOULD RETURN TO 5000 FT. BEING VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS RTE AND KNOWING THAT A CLB IS USUALLY GIVEN AT THIS POINT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MY PREMATURE CLB TO 5300 FT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT A BETTER CLRNC WOULD HAVE BEEN 'R TURN 060 DEGS;' OR 'R TURN 060 DEGS MAINTAIN 5000 FT.'

321,6000,15,WHILE BEING VECTORED BY ZBW; I HAD A VERY CLOSE NEAR MISS WITH A COMMUTER. ZBW WAS UNABLE TO CLR ME FOR THE LDA RWY 19 APCH AT RUT DUE TO DEPARTING TFC. ATC VECTORED ME AROUND; KEEPING ME N OF IRA NDB AT 7000 FT. WHILE STAYING IN RADAR CONTACT; AND BEING VECTORED AROUND; I MADE RADIO CONTACT WITH THE ACFT ON THE GND (AT RUT); WHICH WAS PREPARING FOR TKOF. THE PLT WAS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE TO ME; ALTHOUGH I DID TELL HIM I WAS IN IMC CONDITIONS; AND ON AN IFR FLT PLAN WITH ZBW; INBOUND TO RUT. VERY SHORTLY AFTER THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE OTHER ACFT CTR CLRED ME DIRECT TO IRA; AND CLRED LDA RWY 19 AT RUT. CTR ALSO SAID THAT THE VOID TIME FOR THE DEPARTING ACFT HAD ELAPSED. AT THAT MOMENT I SAW THE BE02 JUST 500 FT LOWER AND 1/2 MI ACROSS FROM ME. I WAS AT 7000 FT MSL; AND TOLD CTR THAT I SAW THE BE02. THE BE02 PLT TOLD CTR THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN ME. THE BE02 WAS ADVISING CTR HE WAS AT 6000 FT AND REQUESTING 7000 FT; AND ALSO REQUESTING HIS IFR CLRNC. BAD JUDGEMENT TO DEPART RUT AND FLY INTO IMC; WAS MADE BY THE PLT WHO LACKED EXPERIENCE.

WITH NO TIME TO RESPOND WE SIMULTANEOUSLY GRABBED THE YOKE; PULLING THE AUTOPLT TO DISCONNECT. THIS ACFT HAD NO LIGHTS ON WHATSOEVER AND NO XPONDER.

324,1400,5,DEPARTED TEB ON VFR TRIP TO ACK. WX BRIEFING INDICATED CIG'S 2000 FT TO 5000 FT ALONG RTE WITH POSSIBLE ICE IN CLOUDS. VISIBILITY WAS GENERALLY 5 MI OR BETTER. NO INDICATION OF SNOWSHOWERS AT RPTING STATIONS ALONG RTE. I DECIDED VFR AT 1500 FT WAS BETTER THAN IFR IN CLOUDS WHERE ICE MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED AND WAS RPTED. HAD FLT FOLLOWING WITH NY TRACON UNTIL BDR CLASS D. CONTACTED BDR TWR. RPTED 'CLR E' AND WAS ADVISED TO CONTACT HVN TWR -- STILL IN GOOD VMC. ABOUT 7 MI W OF HVN ENCOUNTERED HVY SNOWSHOWERS. CONTACTED HVN TWR AND WAS TOLD 'FIELD IS IFR; 800 FT OVCST.' AT THIS TIME I EXECUTED A 180 DEG TURN TOWARDS THE S AND WAS ADVISED BY HVN TWR; 'APCH HAS ADVISED OF A CONFLICT WITH AN ACFT ON RWY 2 APCH COURSE.' I ELECTED TO TURN L APPROX 260 DEGS FROM A HDG OF 170 DEGS BACK THROUGH N TO 270 DEGS. THIS PROLONGED MY TIME IN IMC; BUT TURNED ME AWAY FROM THE RWY 02 APCH COURSE. AS SOON AS I ESTABLISHED THE 270 DEG HDG VMC CONDITIONS RESUMED. THE PROB AROSE BECAUSE I HAD GOOD VISIBILITY INITIALLY IN THE SNOWSHOWERS AND ASSUMED THEY WERE A LCL PHENOMENA. THE GENERAL POOR VISIBILITY OVER LONG ISLAND SOUND AT NIGHT MASKED THE TRUE SIZE OF THE SNOWSHOWER ACTIVITY. I FEEL MY CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS SWIFT; ALTHOUGH I DID NOT IDENT THE IMC CONDITION IN A TIMELY ENOUGH MANNER. THE GOOD WX AT BDR LED ME TO CONCLUDE THAT HVN WAS OKAY; VMC. THIS WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE EARLIER WX BRIEFING. I AM REALLY ANGRY WITH MYSELF FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE HVN ATIS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE TWR. THIS WAS AN INEXCUSABLE; LAZY; AND UNNECESSARY OVERSIGHT. NEVER AGAIN. ALTHOUGH THIS EVENT IS A VMC INTO IMC INCIDENT; IT HAS MADE ME RE-EVALUATE MY GENERAL OPERATING GUIDELINES FOR VFR VERSUS IFR. I CONTINUED THE FLT SUCCESSFULLY IN GOOD VFR AT 9500 FT. AS A SINGLE ENG; NO ICE AIRPLANE DRIVER; I HAVE OFTEN OPTED FOR THE 'SCUDDY' FLT OVER FILING IFR. IN THIS CASE; THIS WAS A TRULY POOR CHOICE. TEB AND ACK AND MOST OF THE RTE HAD IMPROVING VFR. IT WAS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO FILE IFR AND CLB VMC TO TOP ANY SNOWSHOWER ACTIVITY IN THE AREA. BUT AS SOON AS THE WX BRIEFING RPTED 'ICE' I DISCOUNTED IFR AS A POSSIBLE CHOICE. FURTHERMORE; I REMEMBER THINKING OVER BDR THAT I COULD SEE THE 'STARS ABOVE' IN MOST DIRECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW WHY I CONTINUED INTO THE SNOWSHOWER ACTIVITY WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY TO CLB VFR TO SEE HOW HIGH THE SNOW PRODUCING CLOUDS WERE. AT THAT POINT; A GO-NO-GO DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT PRESSURE. THE CLASSIC HUMAN FACTORS WERE AT WORK HERE. I WAS LATE FOR A PLANNED DINNER AND MY 'GET-THERE-ITIS' MADE IT TOO EASY TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I COULD SEE THE EDGE OF THE SNOWSHOWERS. THIS ALSO DISTRACTED ME; AND CAUSED ME TO 'FORGET' TO LISTEN TO THE HVN ATIS.

325,4500,20,ON FEB/SUN/97; I FLEW WITH 2 PAX FROM LWM TO RKD ON A SIGHT-SEEING FLT. DURING THE TRAINING FLT; COM #1 HAD SOME AUDIO DISTORTION; AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MARGINAL SQUELCH SETTING. I USED COM #2 AS MY PRIMARY RADIO FOR THE FLT. WE WERE USING A BATTERY-PWRED INTERCOM FOR THE PLT AND BOTH PAX. I WAS USING A YOKE-MOUNTED VFR GPS (GARMIN 195). THE GPS WAS RUNNING ON A CIGARETTE-LIGHTER PLUG INTERFACE TO THE ACFT ELECTRICAL SYS; WITH ITS INTERNAL RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AS BACKUP. THE BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED AT THE START OF THE DAY; IT HAS A 7 HR LIFE-SPAN WITH NO BACK-LIGHT. I HAD A HAND-HELD RADIO (ICOM ICA-21) IN MY FLT BAG. IT STARTED THE DAY WITH A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY AS WELL. THE FLT NORTHWARD COMMENCED AT XY30 LCL; AND WAS UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT FOR THE #1 COM RADIO ACTING UP. WE LANDED. ON THE SBOUND FLT AT 4500 FT MSL; NAV WAS VISUAL; VOR AND GPS. WE WERE RECEIVING ADVISORIES FROM ATC; WERE SQUAWKING A CODE AND WERE IN CONTACT WITH BRUNSWICK; PORTLAND; AND MANCHESTER APCH CTLRS. OUR ELECTRICAL FAILURE OCCURRED WHILE WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH MANCHESTER APCH 125.05. WE WERE FLYING INTO A SUNSET; AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE LNDG WAS GOING TO EFFECTIVELY BE A NIGHT LNDG. THE SBOUND FLT PROCEEDED NORMALLY UNTIL FAILURE OF RADIO #1 LESS THAN 20 MI N OF PSM. THE DISPLAY BEGAN FLASHING ERRATICALLY; I CONCLUDED THAT #1 RADIO FAILED. I SHUT OFF RADIO #1. MANCHESTER APCH RPTED LOSS OF MY SQUAWK; AND REQUESTED THAT I RECYCLE MY XPONDER. I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT ON THE XPONDER HAD BEEN REMAINING ON SOLIDLY; AND IT WAS DIM. UPON RECYCLING THE XPONDER; MANCHESTER APCH STILL DID NOT RECEIVE MY SQUAWK. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT RADIO #2 FAILED IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS #1. I TURNED OFF RADIO #2. I TURNED TOWARD PSM WHICH WAS IN SIGHT AND AT ABOUT 4 MI. I SET MY XPONDER FOR 7600 AND PRESSED IDENT. NO LIGHT CAME ON AND I REALIZED THAT THE XPONDER WAS OUT. IT WAS THEN THAT I CHKED THE ALTERNATOR (GENERATOR?) METER FOR CHARGING CURRENT AND IT READ ZERO. I INTERPRETED THIS AS AN ALTERNATOR FAILURE; AND REALIZED THAT WE HAD ONLY BATTERY PWR LEFT. I TURNED OFF ALL ELECTRICALS EXCEPT THE TAIL STROBE. I ASKED MY WIFE; WHO WAS IN THE BACK SEAT TO GIVE ME THE HAND-HELD RADIO. I TRIED CALLING MANCHESTER APCH ON 125.05; BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. I WAS ALMOST ON TOP OF PSM AT 4500 FT MSL AT THIS POINT; SO I CALLED PSM TWR; AND ASKED THEM TO RELAY MY SIT TO APCH. I CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS EFFECTIVELY NO DIFFERENCE IN SAFETY LNDG AT PSM OR LNDG AT LWM ABOUT 12 MINS AWAY. I INFORMED MANCHESTER APCH OF MY INTENTIONS; AND THEY ASKED TO BE INFORMED WHEN I SWITCHED TO LWM TWR FREQ. AT THIS TIME; I LOOKED DOWN AT MY GPS WHICH WAS ON THE HSI DISPLAY PAGE. THE WAYPOINT IT WAS NAVING TO WAS LWM; WHICH IS CORRECT FOR LAWRENCE ARPT. IT INDICATED A GND TRACK REQUIRED OF ABOUT 240 DEGS. I TURNED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE WAYPOINT AND PRESSED 'GOTO' AND 'ENTER' TO CREATE A NEW RADIAL TO THE WAYPOINT. THE DEFAULT WAYPOINT IN THE GOTO SCREEN IS THE CURRENT GOTO WAYPOINT; THIS IS A QUICK WAY TO RESET THE COURSE LINE. CREATING THE NEW RADIAL RE- CTRED THE NEEDLE; AND I BEGAN CAREFULLY NAVING DIRECTLY TO LWM. I USED A FEATURE OF THE GARMIN 195 WHICH GIVES VERT NAV INFO; AND BEGAN A DSCNT OF 500 FPM BASED UPON GPS INFO. I THOUGHT I HAD IDENTED THE ARPT VICINITY AT 12 O'CLOCK; BUT THIS LATER TURNED OUT TO BE ROCKINGHAM PARK; A RACETRACK. I LATER REALIZED THAT THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS ALONG WITH THE NAVIGATIONAL ISSUES CAUSED ME TO NOT COMPLETE MY FULL LNDG CHKLIST. I LANDED WITHOUT THE MIXTURE IN THE FULL RICH POS. THIS WAS A PROCEDURAL ERROR ON MY PART. THE HSI SCREEN OF THE GPS WAS GIVING ME ERRONEOUS INFO; BUT THE MAP SCREEN WAS CORRECT. I REALIZED THAT THE HSI DISPLAY WAS STEERING ME ON A PARALLEL TRACK; BUT 5.6 MI TO THE R (NW) OF THE CORRECT COURSE. I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SWITCHED TO THE MAP DISPLAY; I LOOKED FOR THE LUBBER LINE ON THE STRIP COMPASS. ON THE GARMIN 195; THE LUBBER LINE ALWAYS INDICATES THE GND TRACK TO THE CURRENT WAYPOINT. THE LUBBER LINE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN; EVEN THOUGH THE HSI DISPLAY INDICATED MY WAYPOINT WAS DEAD AHEAD. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SOFTWARE BUG IN THE GARMIN 195 (SOFTWARE VERSION 2.01) SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE HSI DISPLAY. I VISUALLY PICKED UP THE ARPT OFF THE L WING AND TURNED TO ENTER A WIDE DOWNWIND FOR RWY 32 AT LWM. I ANNOUNCED MY TURN TO FINAL ON THE HAND-HELD. THE LWM TWR CTLR (CTLR #1) CLRED THE OTHER ACFT FOR DEP. THIS WAS A NIGHT LNDG AND ONE WITH A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL FAILURE. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRUDENT TO HOLD UP THE ACFT ON THE GND UNTIL I WAS DOWN AND OUT OF THE PATTERN. I HAD NOT DECLARED AN EMER. I STARTED THE FLT WITH 3 LEVELS OF NAV: VISUAL; GPS; VOR. AFTER THE ELECTRICAL SYS FAILURE; I SEEMED TO GET 'TUNNEL VISION' ON THE GPS; EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATING ANY XCHK WITH MY VISUAL NAV. I THINK CTLR #2 HAD A HARD TIME JUDGING MY DISTANCE WHEN I WAS ON FINAL APCH. I HAD ONLY A TAIL STROBE VISIBLE. THE A&P MECH VERIFIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED A VOLTAGE REGULATOR FAILURE. THE ALTERNATOR ITSELF WAS REBUILT WITHIN THE LAST YR. GARMIN VERIFIED THAT THEIR SOFTWARE UPDATES (THEY ARE UP TO 2.04; MY UNIT WAS 2.01) HAD CORRECTED BUGS IN THE HSI DISPLAY. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE UNIT BACK FROM GARMIN AS OF THIS WRITING.,pa28 pvt plt suffer A loss OF hi altern but delay IN recognit OF hi prob . after deal that ; HE run into A prob use hi gp which IS now ON batteri pwr .

THE TA AND THE XMISSION TO THEM TO CLB THROUGH OUR ALT CAME AT SAME TIME. WE THEN ACQUIRED THE B737 VISUALLY AS THEY WERE BEING TOLD TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION. THE NEXT XMISSION WAS INFORMING US OF THEIR INTENT TO WHICH I RESPONDED ROGER AND THEY SHOULD PASS BEHIND US. BY SAYING THAT I WAS TRYING TO INFORM THEM THAT OUR 280 KIAS CRUISE SPD AND THEIR CLB SPD WOULD RESULT IN A CPA OF COLLISION COURSE IF THEY DID NOT PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

I ADMIT WE WERE BOTH (FO AND MYSELF) UNEASY WHEN SECOND SIT WAS DEVELOPING; BUT WAS EXECUTED FLAWLESSLY BY THE ACR B CREW. 2 MONTHS EARLIER FEB/XX/97; ANOTHER ACR A B737 DID THE SAME AS THIS ONE DID AND CLBED RIGHT AT US ON THE SAME CLB THROUGH AND MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION CLRNC RESULTING IN AN RA; HOWEVER THIS CREW WAS EVEN MORE NAIVE THEN APR/YY/97; ACR A CREW AS THEY SAID 'WE GOT A TCASII RA ON THAT!' AFTER THEY CAUSED IT. ONE COULD SURMISE A PROB AT ACR A TRAINING ON B737; NOT A VERY FAST JET VERSUS ACR B ON MD80 A FASTER JET THAT CLBS UP THROUGH BEHIND EVEN A 'NON JET' ACFT. THE INABILITY OF THE ACR B737 CREW'S TO PLOT CPA'S AND PROCEED ACCORDINGLY IS BECOMING MOST DISCONCERTING. (APR/YY/97; WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND I WAS TOO CLOSE TO NOT SEEING IT THROUGH.) THIS EVENT WAS RPTED TO ZBW WHO WASHED THEIR HANDS OF IT BECAUSE WHEN IT WAS ISSUED IT MET THEIR CRITERIA.,A saab 340 clb TO avoid AN acr b737 which IS pass him visual separ . plt complain that wa not first time such A sit occur same acr . zbw gave clrnc clb use visual separ .

WE then acquir b737 visual AS they be told TO maintain visual separ . next xmission wa inform US OF their intent TO which I respond roger they should pass behind US . BY say that I wa tri TO inform them that 280 kia cruis spd their clb spd would result IN A cpa OF collis cours IF they did not plan accordingli . they proceed TO clb rapidli right AT US result IN A tcasii RA OF 'clb ' A vsi indic OF 1500 fpm OR better TO avoid collis .

328,21000,15,WE WERE ON THE ARR AT FL210. ATC POINTS OUT TFC AT 10 O'CLOCK XING L TO R LEVEL AT FL220; A MIL C5A; WE HAD HIM VISUAL AND ON THE TCASII. IT WAS APPARENT WHEN HE STARTED TO TURN R HE WOULD CROSS ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE US OR SLIGHTLY TO OUR R. WE BRIEFED ON POSSIBLE WAKE TURB AND WHY CTR WOULD VECTOR HIM DIRECTLY OVER US. DURING THAT BRIEF ATC POINTED OUT TFC AT 9 O'CLOCK CLBING TO FL200. I LOOKED BUT COULDN'T PICK HIM UP VISUALLY. I GLANCED AT THE TCASII. HE WAS AT 9 O'CLOCK; 4 MI AND HEADING TOWARDS US TOO. THE C5A WAS NOW AT 12 O'CLOCK AND SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF US. WHILE WATCHING THE C5A THE TCASII GAVE US AN RA AND CLB AT 2000 FPM. I TURNED OFF THE AUTOPLT AND LOOKED FOR THE TFC WHILE STARTING A SLOW CLB TO ALLOW THE C5A TO PASS TO THE R. I SAW THE ACFT WITH ITS IDENT LIGHTS ON COMING AT US. HE LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BUST HIS ALT. I IMMEDIATELY STARTED CLBING AT 2000 FPM. AT 21500 FT THE RA WENT AWAY AND I LEVELED AT 21600 FT. DURING THE CLB THE PNF TOLD CTR WE HAD AN RA AND WERE CLBING. CTR SAID TO GO BACK TO 21000 FT; THE OTHER ACFT LEVELED AT FL200. CTR ALSO SAID HE THOUGHT WE HAD THE CLBING ACFT VISUALLY AND IT SOUNDED LIKE HE THOUGHT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT OUR ALT BECAUSE WE HAD HIM. FIRST; WE DIDN'T WHEN WE GOT THE RA AND SECOND IGNORING THE RA IS AGAINST POLICY. I WAS PUZZLED THAT THE CTLR WITH NO WX AND NO OTHER TFC WITHIN SIGHT OF OUR AREA PUT US ALL IN THAT SIT SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. THE ACFT CLBING BELOW US MUST HAVE HAD A VERY RAPID RATE OF CLB FOR OUR TCASII TO GIVE US A 2000 FPM RA TO CLB.

THE ALT OF THE TARGET WAS SHOWN AS 200 FT BELOW OUR OWN. BOTH OF US LOOKED OUTSIDE TO TRY TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE THE OTHER ACFT. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TCASII TARGET TURNED RED AND THE AURAL CLB COMMAND OF THE TCASII BEGAN TO REPEAT. THE AUTOPLT AND AUTOTHROTTLES WERE DISCONNECTED AND THE NOSE PULLED UP TO APPROX 10 DEGS NOSE UP. THE IVSI RESOLUTION REQUIRED A RATE OF CLB OF ABOUT 900 FPM. SHORTLY AFTER OUR CLB WAS INITIATED; THE TA/RA WENT QUIET. WE ADVISED ATC OF THE SIT AND WERE TOLD THAT ATC WAS NOT TALKING TO THE OTHER ACFT. WE LOWERED THE NOSE AND SMOOTHLY RETURNED TO 11000 FT.

331,1000,3,I CALLED NEW HAVEN TWR WHEN I WAS INBOUND FROM THE E AT 8 MI AS INDICATED ON MY DME. I WAS ASKED TO ENTER A L BASE FOR RWY 20 AND RPT A 2 MI L BASE. I HAD ONLY FLOWN OUT OF THIS ARPT ONCE BEFORE AND WAS RELATIVELY UNFAMILIAR WITH IT SO I WAS KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH ON THE GND IN AN ATTEMPT TO SET MYSELF UP FOR A PERFECT BASE LEG. I WAS ALSO SCANNING FOR TFC BUT FOUND SOME DIFFICULTY DOING SO BECAUSE IT WAS DUSK. AT 2.8 DME I WAS JUST ABOUT TO RPT MY 2 MI L BASE WHEN I SAW A REGIONAL JET TO MY L (THE S) AT MY SAME ALT (1000 FT) COMING STRAIGHT AT ME. THE TWR CTLR THEN ASKED MY DISTANCE (2.8 DME) BUT BEFORE I COULD ANSWER HE INSTRUCTED ME TO TURN R. THE ACFT CLBED AND TURNED TO THE R. I LATER LEARNED THAT I HAD SET OFF HIS TCASII SYS DURING DISCUSSION OVER THE RADIO ON THE GND. I HAD NOT YET REACHED A 2 MI BASE AND UNFORTUNATELY BOTH ACFT WERE ON INTERSECTING PATHS. THE TWR NEVER CALLED THE TFC OUT TO ME WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED. THIS PROB COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE TWR CTLR HAD RADAR.

I TURNED AND EXPEDITED THE B747 AND DSNDED THE BE02. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 371379: AS WE WERE CLBING THROUGH 14000 FT WE HAD A TCASII ALERT AT OUR 5 O'CLOCK POS. I LOOKED FOR A VISUAL ON THE TFC. THERE WAS A B747 BELOW US ABOUT 3-5 MI AND CLBING. AT THAT POINT; ATC CALLED AND SAID TO DSND TO 11000 FT. AFTER CAREFUL EVALUATION OF THE SIT; I DECIDED NOT TO DO WHAT I WAS INSTRUCTED BY ATC. I FELT THAT IF WE STARTED TO DSND THAT WE WOULD HAVE CLIPPED THE B747 OR WE WOULD HAVE HIT ITS WAKE TURB. I ELECTED TO MAKE A TURN TO THE L TO PARALLEL THE FLT PATH OF THE B747. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED WITHIN A FEW SECONDS. AS I STARTED THE EVASIVE ACTION; THE B747 CAME INTO VIEW AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS. WE WERE VERY CLOSE AND THE FLC STATED THAT WE WERE 400 METERS AWAY. THE ENTIRE TIME; ATC NEVER STATED A TFC ALERT. THE ATC OPERATOR HAD NO URGENCY OF THE SIT IN HER VOICE.

341,1200,0,I WAS FLYING A SINGLE ENG AIRPLANE AT AN UNCTLED ARPT. I ENTERED THE PATTERN AT A 45 DEG ANGLE AND PROCEEDED TO FLY THE DOWNWIND LEG OF THE PATTERN. WHILE ON THE DOWNWIND LEG A TWIN ENG AIRPLANE CROSSED THE PATTERN AT A 90 DEG ANGLE A FEW HUNDRED FT ABOVE PATTERN ALT AND 1/4 MI IN FRONT OF ME. THIS WAS DONE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT I WAS ALREADY IN THE PATTERN AND HAD RIGHT-OF-WAY. I OBSERVED THE TWIN ENG AIRPLANE AS IT CROSSED MY PATH IN THE PATTERN. SINCE THE TWIN ENG AIRPLANE WAS A FEW HUNDRED FT ABOVE MY ALT; 1/4 MI AHEAD OF ME AND FLYING FASTER THAN ME; I REALIZED THAT WE WERE NOT ON A COLLISION COURSE. IN ANY EVENT; I PULLED BACK ON THE THROTTLE IN ORDER TO SLOW MY AIRSPD SO AS NOT TO GET ANY CLOSER TO THE TWIN ENG THAN I ALREADY WAS. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE PROB IS THE LIKELY POSSIBILITY THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG CTAF. HOWEVER; A RADIO IS NOT REQUIRED AT AN UNCTLED ARPT SINCE THERE IS NOT A TWR A THE ARPT. THEREFORE; WHETHER I WAS ON THE RIGHT FREQ OR NOT DID NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT-OF-WAY SINCE I WAS ALREADY IN THE PATTERN AND IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TWIN ENG TO STAY CLR OF THE TFC ALREADY IN THE PATTERN. PLTS ARE SUPPOSED TO USE 'SEE AND AVOID' PROCS AT UNCTLED ARPTS; WHICH THE PLT OF THE TWIN ENG DID NOT ADEQUATELY DO.

AFTER THE RA WAS CLRED AND WE WERE ON A 360 DEG HDG; THE CTLR WAS VERY HELPFUL IN POINTING OUT THE WX AND GIVING US PIREPS FROM OTHER ACFT IN THE AREA. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ATC FREQ WAS VERY CONGESTED WITH ACFT WORKING AROUND WX; WITH SIMILAR CALL SIGNS.

350,4300,7,I DEPARTED MVY RWY 24 AT ABOUT KK20 ON AUG/LL/97. WHILE CLBING TO 4500 FT; I TURNED TO A HDG OF APPROX 285 DEGS AND CONTACTED CAPE APCH ON 124.7. I WAS TOLD TO STAND BY. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINS OF WAITING; I CALLED AGAIN. THE CTLR APOLOGIZED FOR THE DELAY AND ASSIGNED ME A XPONDER CODE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; HE SAID THAT MY XPONDER APPEARED INOP AND ASKED IF IT WAS SHOWING A REPLY LIGHT. I SAID THAT IT WAS. NEXT HE SAID HE WAS RECEIVING MY XPONDER BUT THAT IT WAS ALTERNATING BTWN THE ASSIGNED CODE AND 1200. HE THEN ASKED IF PERHAPS I SAW TFC 400 FT ABOVE ME. MY FRONT SEAT PAX AND I BOTH LOOKED AND SAW NOTHING. WE WERE NOW AT APPROX 4300 FT; CLBING AT ABOUT 105 KTS. A VERY BRIEF SECOND LATER A PIPER CHEROKEE APPEARED FROM ABOVE DSNDING THROUGH OUR ALT AND BANKING AWAY AT OUR 8 O'CLOCK POS. I BELIEVE WE MAY HAVE PASSED WITHIN 200 FT OF EACH OTHER. THE CTLR SAID THAT HE NOW SAW 2 ACFT; ME AND ANOTHER SQUAWKING 1200. AFTERWARD; IN A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH THE CTLR; HE EXPLAINED THAT IF 2 ACFT WERE SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE THEY WOULD APPEAR AS ONE ON RADAR AND THAT THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN THE EARLIER PROB WITH MY XPONDER. I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE BEEN CLBING DIRECTLY BELOW AND SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF THE CHEROKEE; AT APPROX THE SAME SPD AND HDG; FOR MOST OF THE TIME WHILE WAITING FOR THE CTLR TO CALL ME BACK. THIS DELAY ALLOWED THESE 2 ACFT TO GET SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE THAT IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CTLR TO TELL US APART. ALTHOUGH IT IS ALWAYS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PLT TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION IN VFR CONDITIONS; A MORE TIMELY IDENT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS SIT FROM DEVELOPING TO THE POINT WHERE AN EVASIVE MANEUVER BECAME NECESSARY.,AN sma over mvi ; MA ; ha A near miss anoth sma AS their flt path coincid tracon can not receiv 2 separ target . eventu 2 acft sight one anoth take evas action .

I wa told TO stand BY . after about 5 min OF wait ; I call again . ctlr apolog delay assign ME A xponder code . shortli thereaft ; HE said that MY xponder appear inop ask IF IT wa show A repli light . I said that IT wa . next HE said HE wa receiv MY xponder but that IT wa altern btwn assign code 1200 . HE then ask IF perhap I saw tfc 400 FT abov ME . MY front seat pax I both look saw noth . WE now AT approx 4300 FT ; clbing AT about 105 kt . A veri brief second later A piper cheroke appear abov dsnding through alt bank away AT 8 o'clock po . I believ WE may have pass within 200 FT OF each other . ctlr said that HE now saw 2 acft ; ME anoth squawk 1200 . afterward ; IN A brief convers ctlr ; HE explain that IF 2 acft suffici close they would appear AS one ON radar that thi might explain earlier prob MY xponder . I believ I may have been clbing directli below slightli ahead OF cheroke ; AT approx same spd hdg ; most OF time wait ctlr TO call ME back . thi delay allow these 2 acft TO get suffici close that IT becam imposs ctlr TO tell US apart . although IT IS alway respons OF plt TO maintain visual separ IN vfr condit ; A more time ident would have prevent thi sit develop TO point where AN evas maneuv becam necessari . ,AN SMA OVER MVY; MA; HAS A NEAR MISS WITH ANOTHER SMA AS THEIR FLT PATHS COINCIDE AND THE TRACON CANNOT RECEIVE 2 SEPARATE TARGETS. EVENTUALLY THE 2 ACFT SIGHT ONE ANOTHER AND TAKE EVASIVE ACTION.
351,2000,10,I WAS ENRTE FROM MVY TO ACK IFR. I WAS ON A 090 DEG VECTOR. I WAS IN AND OUT OF CLOUDS AT THIS ALT. I NOTICED A LOW WING PIPER 12:30 - 1 O'CLOCK; COMING AT ME; LNDG OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I CALLED CAPE APCH AND ASKED 'ARE YOU PAINTING TFC IN THE VICINITY OF YYQ.' THEIR REPLY: YES; TFC (I THINK THEY SAID 4 O'CLOCK) AT 2400 FT; UNVERIFIED. (OBVIOUSLY AFTER IT PASSED ME.) IT WOULD BE NICE IF THESE MORONS FILED IFR WHEN THEY FLY IN AND OUT OF CLOUDS. I WAS ABLE TO READ PARTIAL N-NUMBER. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH; I HEARD A PIPER WITH THE SAME PARTIAL N-NUMBER ASKING FOR ADVISORIES -- PROBABLY THE SAME IDIOT. I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU HAVE MASSACHUSETTS DRIVERS IN THE AIR.,AN sma fli IN fmh ; MA ; airspac ON AN ifr flt plan ha A sever near miss AS AN acft fli opposit direct fli close BY .

352,1900,3,I WAS DEPARTING RWY 23 AT LWM IN A C150 SBOUND; WHEN I HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A PIPER CHEROKEE ON CLBOUT BEHIND ME. IN THE RUNUP AREA I RECALL A C172 AND A CHEROKEE BESIDES OUR C150. THE C172 DEPARTED FIRST WITH A L TURN; THEN WE WERE CLRED FOR TKOF WITH A STRAIGHT-OUT DEP. OUT CLBOUT SPD WAS 75-80 MPH. I RECALL HEARING ANOTHER ACFT BEING CLRED FOR TKOF WITH A STRAIGHT-OUT DEP BEHIND US. I ASSUME IT WAS THE CHEROKEE I SAW IN THE RUNUP AREA. PROBABLY BTWN 3 AND 4 MI OUT; I ASKED TWR FOR A FREQ CHANGE; SO I COULD PICK UP A SQUAWK CODE AND RADAR ADVISORIES FROM BOS APCH. TWR APPROVED MY FREQ CHANGE AND WE CONTACTED APCH. WE WERE IMMEDIATELY GIVEN A CODE AND I REQUESTED FLT FOLLOWING; DIRECT PUT. AFTER BEING ON THE BOS APCH FREQ FOR A SHORT TIME; PERHAPS 2 MINS; A PIPER CHEROKEE TYPE ACFT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER US EXACTLY ON OUR HDG. I RPTED THIS TO APCH; AND TOLD THEM THAT THE OTHER ACFT HAD COME WITHIN 50 FT OF US. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SEPARATION VERTLY WAS CLOSER TO 25 FT. LATERAL SEPARATION WAS NEARLY ZERO. I LEVELED AND BEGAN A SLIGHT R TURN. THE CHEROKEE BEGAN SLOWLY TURNING TO MY L AND APPARENTLY ON COURSE. THE TIME WAS APPROX XA10Z. FROM THE ACFT ACTIONS; I ASSUMED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ME. I FURTHER ASSUME THAT HE WAS STILL ON THE TWR FREQ AT THE TIME. I TOLD APCH THAT I WANTED TO FILE A NEAR MISS RPT. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO DO THAT WITH THE FSDO. I SAID THAT I JUST WANTED THAT REQUEST ON THE TAPE. I ASKED APCH IF THEY SHOWED THE OTHER TARGET ON THEIR SCREEN. INITIALLY HE DID NOT RPT THE OTHER TARGET. PERHAPS 30 SECONDS LATER HE RPTED A TARGET AT 1900 FT AT MY 11 O'CLOCK POS. I TOLD APCH THAT THAT WAS THE OTHER ACFT. I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OTHER ACFT AND I HAD ALREADY CLBED ABOVE IT. THE RANGE WAS PERHAPS 1 MI. THIS INDICATES THAT BOTH ACFT WERE SQUAWKING MODE C AND THE RADAR TAPES SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE STORY. WE REQUESTED AN ALT OF 4500 FT; BUT WERE INSTRUCTED TO REMAIN CLR OF BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE. I REMAINED AT ABOUT 2200 FT FOR SEVERAL MI; UNTIL THE CTLR CLRED US INTO BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE AT 4500 FT DIRECT PUT. I BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER PLT FAILED IN HIS DUTY TO SEE AND AVOID MY ACFT ON HIS DEP. THE FACT THAT IT WAS A 'HIGH WING/LOW WING' SIT MAY HAVE EXACERBATED THE PROB. THERE WERE SPECIAL EVENTS SCHEDULED AT THE ARPT THAT DAY; AND THERE WAS A HIGH NUMBER OF ARRS AND DEPS TAKING PLACE.,nmac btwn A high wing c150 make A straight out dep ON rwi hdg ; about 3 MI arpt ; A low wing piper cheroke ; also ON A straight out dep ; take off behind c150 ; pass c150 about 25 FT abov . rpting c150 plt made AN immedi turn TO R TO help increas futur separ . I wa depart rwi 23 AT lwm IN A c150 sbound ; when I A near miss A piper cheroke ON clbout behind ME .

I recal hear anoth acft be clred tkof A straight-out dep behind US .

WE immedi given A code I request flt ; direct put . after be ON bo apch freq A short time ; perhap 2 min ; A piper cheroke type acft flew directli over US exactli ON hdg . I rpted thi TO apch ; told them that other acft come within 50 FT OF US . IT IS probabl that separ vertli wa closer TO 25 ft. later separ wa nearli zero . I level began A slight R turn . cheroke began slowli turn TO MY L appar ON cours . time wa approx xa10z . acft action ; I assum HE never seen ME . I further assum that HE wa still ON twr freq AT time . I told apch that I want TO file A near miss rpt . they told ME I need TO DO that fsdo . I said that I just want that request ON tape . I ask apch IF they show other target ON their screen . initi HE did not rpt other target . perhap 30 second later HE rpted A target AT 1900 FT AT MY 11 o'clock po . I told apch that that wa other acft . I visual contact other acft I alreadi clbed abov IT . rang wa perhap 1 MI . thi indic that both acft squawk mode C radar tape should tell whole stori . WE request AN alt OF 4500 FT ; but instruct TO remain clr OF boston class B airspac . I remain AT about 2200 FT sever MI ; until ctlr clred US into boston class B airspac AT 4500 FT direct put . I believ that other plt fail IN hi duti TO see avoid MY acft ON hi dep . fact that IT wa A 'high wing/low wing ' sit may have exacerb prob . there special event schedul AT arpt that day ; there wa A high number OF arr dep take place . ,NMAC BTWN A HIGH WING C150 MAKING A STRAIGHT OUT DEP ON RWY HDG; ABOUT 3 MI FROM THE ARPT; AND A LOW WING PIPER CHEROKEE; ALSO ON A STRAIGHT OUT DEP; TAKING OFF BEHIND THE C150; AND PASSING THE C150 ABOUT 25 FT ABOVE. THE RPTING C150 PLT MADE AN IMMEDIATE TURN TO THE R TO HELP INCREASE FUTURE SEPARATION.

BOTH MYSELF AND THE PNF HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT AS THE VISIBILITY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD. WE RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT AND THE ZBW CTLR RESPONDED BY INSTRUCTING US TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION WITH THE TFC AND DSND AND MAINTAIN 13000 FT. WE ACCEPTED THE CLRNC. IT WAS EVIDENT TO BOTH MYSELF AND THE PNF THAT WE WOULD PASS AHEAD AND ABOVE THE CONVERGING TFC. AS WE WERE DSNDING THROUGH 15500 FT (AND AHEAD OF THE TFC) THE CREW OF THE SAAB RPTED TO ZBW THAT THEY HAD OBTAINED AN RA FROM TCASII AND HAD DSNDED. ZBW REPLIED THAT WE HAD ACCEPTED A CLRNC FOR VISUAL SEPARATION AND THAT WE WERE PASSING CLR. IT IS UNKNOWN TO US AS TO EXACTLY WHAT ACTION THE SAAB TOOK AS A RESULT OF THEIR RA. (OUR ACFT IS NOT TCASII EQUIPPED.) IT IS/WAS OUR OPINION THAT THE RA WAS UNNECESSARY AS WE WERE VISUAL WITH THE TFC AND WERE MAINTAINING VISUAL CLRNC. THERE WAS NEVER A QUESTION OF ANY CONFLICT IN OUR OPINION. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN ON OUR PART. ZBW MADE NO FURTHER COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE CREW OF THE SAAB HAD US IN SIGHT OR NOT. DUTY TIME FOR OUR CREW WAS NOT A FACTOR; NOR WAS FATIGUE.

356,15000,0,THE ATR WAS POINTED OUT AS TFC (TO THE DC8) BY ZBW CTLR AND THE DC8 WAS ALSO POINTED OUT TO THE ATR. THE ATR RESPONDED TO THE TFC CALL BY STATING THE DC8 WAS ON TCASII. WHEN THE DC8 SAW THE ATR TFC FROM APPROX 2 MI AND CALLED 'TFC IN SIGHT' TO ATC; THE CTR CTLR THEN ISSUED A CLRNC (DC8) TO 'CLB AT PLT'S DISCRETION TO 17000 FT.' NEITHER ACFT HAD LEVELED AT 15000 FT; 'ATR DSNDING AND DC8 CLBING.' THE ATR APPEARED AT FIRST SIGHTING TO BE ON A PARALLEL COURSE TO THE DC8 SO NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN ON EITHER PART. THE TCASII ON THE ATR MUST HAVE URGED THE ATR CREW TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION AND BY THE TIME A CLOSE COURSE WAS NEAR BOTH ACFT TURNED R TO AVOID A COLLISION. I BELIEVE THE CLRNC BY ATC FOR BOTH ACFT AT 15000 FT AND THE CLRNC FOR PLT DISCRETION TO CLB (DC8) TO 17000 FT WERE CONFUSING AND AMBIGUOUS AND LED TO THIS NEAR MIDAIR OR NEAR-MISS. I BELIEVE THE TCASII WAS THE SAVING GRACE ON THE ATR AND WISH TCASII WAS INSTALLED ON DC8 FREIGHTERS.

THE ACR RECEIVED A TCASII TA AND AT THE SAME TIME THE CTLR TOLD THE ACR TO MAINTAIN 6000 FT FOR TFC. THE ACR HAD THE OTHER ACFT IN SIGHT AND CLBED BACK TO 6000 FT.
361,2200,10,ON APPROX 10 MI FINAL FOR PVD RWY 23; WE WERE GIVEN A 200 DEG HDG TO FOLLOW ACFT Y; B737; ON A L DOWNWIND. ACR Y EXTENDED HIS DOWNWIND FAR ENOUGH AS TO TURN DIRECTLY TOWARDS US ON HIS BASE TURN. I DID GET DISTRACTED; ASKED APCH FOR A TURN TO RWY; CONSIDERING I WAS BTWN ACR Y AND THE RWY. APCH SAID HE WAS ALREADY WITH TWR. THE B737 WAS COMING DIRECTLY TOWARDS US. I LOST 200-300 FT ALT AND MADE AN EVASIVE MANEUVER; CLBED 500 FT AND TURNED TO A 090 DEG HDG. ACR Y PASSED OFF OUR R. I TOLD APCH I WAS TURNING L AND THEY WANTED ME TO TURN R 310 DEG HDG. AFTER B737 PASSED; I TURNED R 310 DEG HDG. I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTED ACR Y TO EXTEND SO FAR; BUT WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE; IT BECAME VERY CONFUSING AS TO THE 'SO CALLED' PLAN THE CTLR HAD. WE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN TURNED INTO HIS POTENTIAL FLT PATH. AS THE PF; I LET MYSELF GET DISTRACTED AND MY ALT LOSS WAS UNACCEPTABLE. I SHOULD HAVE BROKEN OFF THE APCH EARLIER AND PUSHED ATC TO GIVE US A REASONABLE PLAN.,A be02 wa vector sequenc A visual apch TO A b737 ON AN extend downwind leg . when b737 turn base leg TO final ; be02 wa IN A po btwn b737 rwi . be02 execut AN evas maneuv wa resequenc BY apch ctl .

I told apch I wa turn L they want ME TO turn R 310 deg hdg . after b737 pass ; I turn R 310 deg hdg . I DO n't think anyon expect acr Y TO extend SO far ; but when WE found ourselv IN middl ; IT becam veri confus AS TO 'so call ' plan ctlr . WE should have never been turn into hi potenti flt path . AS PF ; I let myself get distract MY alt loss wa unaccept . I should have broken off apch earlier push atc TO give US A reason plan . ,A BE02 WAS VECTORED AND SEQUENCED FOR A VISUAL APCH TO FOLLOW A B737 ON AN EXTENDED DOWNWIND LEG. WHEN THE B737 TURNED BASE LEG TO FINAL; THE BE02 WAS IN A POS BTWN THE B737 AND THE RWY. THE BE02 EXECUTED AN EVASIVE MANEUVER AND WAS RESEQUENCED BY APCH CTL.
362,1400,0,I HAD DSNDED FROM CRUISE ALT OF 3500 FT MSL TO TFC PATTERN ALT OF 1400 FT MSL. I STARTED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE CORRECT WAY TO ENTER THE TFC PATTERN AT THE 45 DEG. ALL ALONG I WAS ANNOUNCING MY INTENTIONS ON WHAT I THOUGHT THE CTAF WAS 123.3; BUT IN ACTUALITY WAS 123.0. TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW HOW I CAME UP WITH THAT FREQ. AS I WAS GETTING CLOSER TO THE ARPT; I NOTICED THAT I WAS ENTERING FROM A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. I KNEW THIS BECAUSE I COULD SEE THE NUMBERS ON THE RWY. JUST AS I NOTICED THIS; I SAW A HIGH WING AIRPLANE TO MY L BANKING INTO ME AND CLOSING. I IMMEDIATELY BANKED MY PLANE TO THE R TO AVOID A COLLISION. HE WAS CONTINUING ON HIS COURSE AND DID NOT SEEM TO BE MAKING ANY CORRECTIONS TO AVOID ME. LUCKILY; HE THEN PASSED BEHIND ME ABOUT 75 FT AWAY. I THEN CONTINUED AROUND IN THE PROPER TFC PATTERN AND LANDED. I WAS ON THE FIRST OF 3 LEGS FOR MY SOLO LONG XCOUNTRY AND HAD NEVER BEEN TO THIS ARPT BEFORE. I THOUGHT I KNEW WHERE I WAS RELATIVE TO THE ARPT. I LEARNED 2 LESSONS: 1) ALWAYS CHK AND BE SURE OF YOUR FREQS AND LOOK OUT WINDOW BEFORE LNDG AT THIS ARPT; YOU DON'T NEED A RADIO. 2) WHEN ENTERING AN UNFAMILIAR UNCTLED ARPT TO OVERFLY AT LEAST 500 FT ABOVE TFC PATTERN TO GET YOUR BEARING. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER PLT INVOLVED WAS NOT PROPERLY LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE HE ALLOWED HIS PLANE TO GET WAY TOO CLOSE TO ME. HE SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME WAY BEFORE I SAW HIM; HE APCHED ME FROM MY L.,nmac btwn A beech 19 ; sport be19 enter tfc pattern AT AN unctl arpt ; A c182 turn downwind IN tfc pattern . rpting student plt wa enter downwind leg IN opposit direct OF c182 ; which wa favor rwi IN use .

TO thi day I DO not know how I came UP that freq . AS I wa get closer TO arpt ; I notic that I wa enter A differ direct previous thought . I knew thi becaus I could see number ON rwi . just AS I notic thi ; I saw A high wing airplan TO MY L bank into ME close . I immedi bank MY plane TO R TO avoid A collis . HE wa continu ON hi cours did not seem TO BE make ani correct TO avoid ME . luckili ; HE then pass behind ME about 75 FT away . I then continu around IN proper tfc pattern land . I wa ON first OF 3 leg MY solo long xcountri never been TO thi arpt befor . I thought I knew where I wa rel TO arpt . I learn 2 lesson : 1 ) alway chk BE sure OF your freq look out window befor lndg AT thi arpt ; you DO n't need A radio . 2 ) when enter AN unfamiliar unctl arpt TO overfli AT least 500 FT abov tfc pattern TO get your bear . I also believ that other plt involv wa not properli look out window becaus HE allow hi plane TO get way too close TO ME . HE should have seen ME way befor I saw him ; HE apch ME MY L . ,NMAC BTWN A BEECH 19; SPORT BE19 ENTERING THE TFC PATTERN AT AN UNCTLED ARPT; AND A C182 TURNING DOWNWIND IN THE TFC PATTERN.

363,3000,5,ILS RWY 33L BOS. SEPARATION ON APCH WAS MINIMAL REFING ACFT IN FRONT OF US. AT ATC REQUEST (APCH CTL) WE WERE MAINTAINING 170 KIAS TO THE MARKER. ON CONTACT WITH TWR WE WERE ADVISED TO EXPECT LNDG CLRNC ON SHORT FINAL; AND THEN WERE IMMEDIATELY TOLD TO GAR; MAINTAIN 3000 FT; HDG 330 DEGS. AFTER BEING GIVEN A SUBSEQUENT R TURN; WE WERE TURNED FURTHER R TO; I BELIEVE; 210 DEGS. AT THIS POINT TCASII ADVISED 'TFC.' THROUGH A BREAK IN CLOUDS; I OBSERVED ACFT Y CORRESPONDING TO THE TCASII LOCATION (FO WAS FLYING). ATC (NOW APCH CTL AGAIN) GAVE US A TURN TO 120 DEGS. IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER; THE TCASII COMMANDED 'MONITOR VERT SPD;' INDICATING A HIGH RATE OF CLB REQUIRED. CLB WAS IMMEDIATELY INITIATED AND THEN ATC ADVISED US TO 'CLB TO 4000 FT -- CLB NOW!' I ADVISED APCH WE WERE ALREADY CLBING. AT 4000 FT; TCASII ADVISED CLR OF CONFLICT. MOST OF THIS WAS IN CLOUDS. I DID NOT SEE THE OTHER ACFT. IN A SUBSEQUENT PHONE CALL TO APCH CTL; THE SUPVR ADVISED HE 'THOUGHT I MIGHT HEAR FROM YOU;' INDICATED THE CTLR 'GAVE [US] THE WRONG HDG.' WHEN THE SUPVR LOOKED UP; WE HAD ACHIEVED LEGAL SEPARATION.

364,5000,50,WE WERE DEPARTING LWM IN IMC; WITH GUSTY SURFACE WINDS AND TURB. OUT INITIAL DEP CLRNC WAS TO 2000 FT. SHORTLY BEFORE REACHING 2000 FT; WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS TO CONTINUE THE CLB. I WAS CONCENTRATING ON ACFT CTL AND MISSED THE CALL; BUT I SAW THE CAPT DIAL IN 6000 FT ON THE ALT ALERTER AND AM POSITIVE I HEARD HIM READ BACK THE ALT ASSIGNMENT AS 6000 FT TO ATC. ATC'S NEXT XMISSION WAS TO ANOTHER ACFT AND THEY DID NOT QUESTION THE READBACK. SHORTLY AFTER LEVELING AT 6000 FT; I HEARD ATC CALL SOMETHING LIKE 'ACFT XX; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT 5000 FT; 5000 FT ACFT XX.' I REDUCED PWR AND STARTED TO DSND WHEN THE CAPT SAID 'NO STAY HERE.' HE WAS TRYING TO GET CONFIRMATION; AND SINCE THE FREQ WAS VERY BUSY; I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE I MISTOOK A CALL THAT WAS INTENDED FOR ANOTHER ACFT. THE CAPT GOT CONFIRMATION; AND I IMMEDIATELY REDUCED PWR TO IDLE AND CONDUCTED A RAPID DSCNT TO 5000 FT. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A DEP CLBOUT IN VERY BUSY BOSTON AIRSPACE. VECTORS WERE BEING GIVEN AT THE USUAL RAPID RATE TO MANY ACFT. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT; INSTRUCTIONS GET MISHEARD QUITE FREQUENTLY. THE TECHNIQUE OF READING BACK CLRNCS SHOULD; AND DOES IN MOST CASES; CATCH THESE ERRORS. IN THIS CASE; IT APPARENTLY DID NOT. IN RETROSPECT; I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE RADIO XMISSIONS EVEN THOUGH I WAS CONCENTRATING ON ACFT CTL. IN A LESS HECTIC ENVIRONMENT; AND/OR WITH INCREASED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; I COULD HAVE CAUGHT THE MISTAKE. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 396712: ZBW THEN SAID TO CLB TO 5000 FT. I READ BACK 5000 FT AND BY MISTAKE DIALED 6000 FT INTO THE ALT PRESELECTOR. AFTER CLBING TO 6000 FT ANOTHER ACFT CLBED FROM 6000 FT TO 6700 FT BASED ON A WARNING GENERATED ON THEIR TCASII. THE FO CONFIRMED 6000 FT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR SOPS. AFTER THE INCIDENT I ASKED HIM WHAT HE HEARD AND HE SAID THAT HE REALLY WASN'T PAYING ATTN TO THE RADIO CALLS.

WE WERE IN IMC CONDITIONS AND I ASSUME THE OTHER ACFT WAS AS WELL. AT 6700 FT DSNDING AT A RATE OF 1000 FPM; WE RECEIVED AN RA ON THE CONFLICTING TFC. THE FIRST COMMAND WAS TO DSND. I BELIEVE THIS WAS DUE TO THE PRESENT DSCNT RATE OF OUR ACFT AND THE HIGH RATE OF CLB OF THE OTHER ACFT. AFTER THE FIRST COMMAND; IT WAS FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO CLB. AT 6400 FT; THE CAPT IMMEDIATELY COMPLIED WITH THE SECOND RA COMMAND. I NOTED AT THIS POINT THE 2 ACFT WERE 500 FT VERTLY AND APPROX 1 MI HORIZLY SEPARATED. AT 6800 FT; THE TCASII INDICATED THAT WE WERE CLR OF CONFLICT. BY MY ESTIMATE THE OTHER ACFT WAS AT 5900 FT AND CLBING WHEN THE RA ADVISED US TO CLB.

WHILE STILL IN THE CLB; ATC CALLED 'TFC 11 O'CLOCK POS AT 17000 FT; AN MDT Y;' AND WE CALLED 'TFC IN SIGHT.' TO THIS HE CALLED 'MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION; CLRED TO FL230' TO WHICH WE REPLIED 'ROGER.' AT ABOUT 16300 FT; WE GOT A TA; TFC 11 O'CLOCK POS AND 3 MI.

367,600,0,I WAS ON SHORT FINAL APCH TO RWY 24 AND A HELI SITTING ON THE APCH END OF RWY 24 ANNOUNCED HE WAS 'MAKING A RUNNING DEP' FROM THE RWY. THIS WAS THE ONLY XMISSION I HAD HEARD AND I DID NOT SEE HIM UNTIL AT APPROX 600 FT MSL. I TURNED TO THE R ANNOUNCING ON 123.0 THAT I WAS TAKING EVASIVE ACTION AND CLBED TO PATTERN ALT (150 FT MSL) THEN TURNED L XWIND AND RE-ENTERED DOWNWIND AND CONTINUED ON TO LAND. SHORTLY THEREAFTER I BROUGHT THE ACFT TO FBO WHO HAD JUST COMPLETED THE ANNUAL INSPECTION BECAUSE THE NEWLY INSTALLED ALTERNATOR WAS INOP. I WAS OPERATING ON BATTERY ALONE. I SUSPECT; AND SINCE FBO SAW RUNNING LIGHTS AND LNDG LIGHTS AND HEARD MY DOWNWIND; BASE AND FINAL ANNOUNCEMENTS THERE WAS PROBABLY NO RELATION TO CAUSE OF CONFLICT. IT WAS NOT WHAT I'D CONSIDER A CLOSE/NEAR MISS -- ONLY THAT I HAD TO MAKE A GAR. I KNOW OF NO VIOLATIONS ON MY PART.

368,6000,13,WE DEPARTED BOS ON RWY 22L. INITIAL HDG WAS 140 DEGS; WITH EVENTUAL VECTORS TO HDG 270 DEGS TOWARDS BAF VOR. AS WE APCHED 6000 FT WHILE CLBING TO 14000 FT WE NOTICED ANOTHER ACFT APCHING FROM R TO L AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSE TO OUR ALT. AT FIRST WE DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS A SMALL ACFT; AN ASSUMPTION THAT SEEMED TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE LACK OF A TCASII RETURN. CONTINUED OBSERVATION STILL PRODUCED NO CONFIRMING TCASII RETURN. BY THE TIME IT BECAME CLR THAT THIS WAS INDEED A SMALL; CLOSE ACFT RATHER THAN A LARGE; DISTANT ACFT; IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE EFFECTIVE EVASIVE ACTION. SINCE THE ACFT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE WINDSCREEN DURING THE ENTIRE EVENT WE REALIZED WE WERE NOT ON A COLLISION COURSE; ALTHOUGH HAD WE REALIZED HOW CLOSE THE ACFT WAS AND WOULD BECOME; WE MOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED SOME TYPE OF EVASIVE MANEUVER. THE OTHER ACFT PASSED IN FRONT OF US; WELL WITHIN 1/2 MI HORIZLY AND ABOUT 200-400 FT ABOVE US. WE COULD CLRLY SEE THAT THE ACFT WAS WHITE WITH A BLUE AFT FUSELAGE AND BLUE TRIM ON THE WINGLETS. WE BELIEVED IT TO BE A CANADAIR CHALLENGER. WE ASKED DEP TO TELL US WHO THE ACFT WAS; AND THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY SHOWED NO TFC. A FURTHER QUESTION REVEALED THAT THEY DID HAVE A PRIMARY TARGET ONLY. UPON OUR ARR IN MEMPHIS; I CALLED THE DEP CTL SUPVR. HE RELATED THAT THE ACFT HAD ALSO DEPARTED BOSTON; HAD NOT TURNED ON ITS XPONDER (HENCE; NO TCASII RETURN); AND HAD SOMEHOW LOST RADIO CONTACT. THE CTLR APPARENTLY DID NOT REALIZE THE ACFT WAS THERE (MY ASSUMPTION). WHEN HE TOLD ME THE ACFT WAS A LEARJET I REALIZED WE MAY HAVE COME EVEN CLOSER THAN MY ESTIMATE SINCE WE HAD ASSUMED THE ACFT WAS A 'WDB' CHALLENGER. THIS WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON THE TCASII. WE ARE SO USED TO CONFIRMING TFC BY XCHKING THE TCASII THAT WE TEND TO NOT BELIEVE OUR EYES WHEN WHAT THEY TELL US DIFFERS FROM THE TCASII. AFTER 4 NEAR MISSES IN THE MIL; THIS WAS MY FOURTH WITH THE AIRLINE. I THINK THAT IS ENOUGH!,flc OF b727 sight AN acft fli across their flt path .

369,6700,25,ON FLT XXX FROM DCA TO BOS WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO DSND FROM 9000 FT TO 7000 FT BY PROVIDENCE APCH. AS WE BEGAN OUR DSCNT WE WERE TO LOOK FOR AN ACR ZZZ B737 AT OUR 2 O'CLOCK POS CLBING FROM 5000 FT TO 8000 FT. WE ADVISED THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TFC AND WERE IMC AT THE TIME.

377,11000,25,FROM OUR POS LISTED ABOVE; WE NOTICED; BUT WERE UNABLE TO VISUALLY ACQUIRE; AN ACFT ON OUR TCASII SCOPE AT 2 O'CLOCK POS AND 10 MI. THIS ACFT WAS IN A SLOW CLB FROM 300 FT BELOW OUR ALT. APCH CALLED THIS ACFT AND GAVE HIM TFC 'A BEECHCRAFT 1900 AT 10 O'CLOCK POS AND 10 MI AT 11000 FT.' THE ACFT SAID HE HAD US IN SIGHT AND WAS TOLD TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION WITH US. APCH THEN CALLED US WITH TFC. HOWEVER; JUST AS HE SPOKE WE RECEIVED A TCASII RA 2500 FPM CLB; WHICH WE OBEYED BECAUSE THE TFC WAS NOT IN SIGHT. THE TFC WAS ALREADY 200 FT ABOVE US SO THIS RA TOOK US THROUGH THEIR ALT. APCH WANTED US TO DSND TO 7000 FT; BUT WE TOLD HIM WE WERE IN A TCASII CLB. NOW; SAFELY ABOVE THE TFC; THE TCASII COMMANDED A 2500 FPM DSCNT. WE IGNORED THIS RA BECAUSE WE SAW THE ACFT PASS BENEATH US. THIS SECOND RA ALSO WANTED US TO PASS THROUGH THE ALT OF THE TFC. WHEN WE FIRST TOLD THE CTLR WE WERE IN A TCASII CLB; HE ASKED WHY WE HAD TO CLB IF THE OTHER ACFT HAD US IN SIGHT. I EXPLAINED THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE HIM IN SIGHT. I BELIEVE THE CTLR'S CONFUSION ABOUT WHEN WE MUST ACT ON AN RA; CONTRIBUTED TO ALLOWING THE OTHER ACFT CLOSE ENOUGH TO CAUSE AN RA. I ALSO BELIEVE THE OTHER ACFT; NOT HAVING TCASII; DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH ROOM TO GIVE A TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT SO AS NOT TO GIVE THEM AN RA.

ABOUT THE TIME I DECIDED HE WASN'T GOING TO TURN; HE SAW US 'FINALLY' AND DEVIATED COURSE AS WE WERE ON FINAL AND BELOW HIM. HE CLAIMS I CUT HIM OFF ON FINAL. AS WE SAW IT HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE ARPT OR THE EXTENDED RWY CTRLINE AND WAS APCHING THE ARPT USING A R BASE APCH TO RWY 30. THE LCL TFC PATTERN IS L HAND. THE UNFORTUNATE PART IS THAT I CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROB BECAUSE MY RADIOS WERE NOT XMITTING; ALTHOUGH THEY WERE RECEIVING. I DID NOT KNOW THIS AT THE TIME; AND AM SURE HE HAD NO IDEA I WAS IN THE PATTERN AS THE DAYLIGHT WAS FADING AND HE COULD NOT HEAR MY CALLS. THERE WAS ALSO LCL FLOAT PLANE ACTIVITY TO ADD TO THE RADIO CONFUSION. AFTER LNDG AND CHKING THE RADIOS; I DISCOVERED I HAD INCORRECTLY CONNECTED MY HEADSETS TO THEM AND THEY DID WORK PROPERLY. HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE WHOLE CONFLICT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THE OTHER PLT FLOWN THE LCL TFC PATTERN THE CORRECT WAY. AFTER A VERY HEATED ARGUMENT WITH A VERY ARROGANT DAKOTA PLT; I WENT AND FOUND MY LCL CFI WHO OBSERVED THE CONFLICT; TO FIND OUT IF I HAD BEEN WRONG.

THE ACFT (Y) AHEAD OF US WAS NOW LESS THAN 1 MI HORIZLY AND 400 FT BELOW OUR ACFT AND CLBING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPD. WE IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A CLB FOLLOWING THE TCASII SUGGESTED CLB RATE. AS WE STARTED CLBING; ATC (BRADLEY) TOLD US TO TURN L TO 030 DEGS AND CLB TO 4000 FT. WE TOLD THEM WE WERE CLBING FOR TFC AHEAD OF US. WE WERE THEN RADAR VECTORED FOR AN ILS APCH RWY 29 AT 4000 FT AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE ACFT THAT ALMOST COLLIDED WITH US WAS ACFT Y; ON A MISSED APCH FROM ILS RWY 29. BRADLEY HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE THE OTHER ACFT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN RADAR COVERAGE. WE WERE CLRED FOR AN INST APCH BEFORE OUR COMPANY WAS CONFIRMED ON THE GND IN ORH! WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING THE ACFT WAS ON A MISSED APCH. BDL APCH DID NOT NOTIFY US UNTIL THE ACFT WAS APPROX 400 FT BELOW OUR ALT; BECAUSE OF RADAR COVERAGE.

386,9000,12,ENRTE EBOUND FROM ISP TO BOS; WE WERE AT 8000 FT MSL ON NEW YORK APCH FREQ 118.00. WE WERE APPROX 1/2 WAY BTWN HTO AND GON VORS. WE WERE THEN HANDED TO NEW YORK APCH FREQ 132.25. SOON WE WERE THEN TOLD TO MAINTAIN 10000 FT MSL AND HANDED BACK TO NEW YORK APCH FREQ 118.0. I ACKNOWLEDGED '10000 FT AND 118.00.' WE CLBED TO 10000 FT MSL AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT NEW YORK ON 118.00. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO 'CHK IN' BEFORE RECEIVING A RESPONSE FROM ATC. THE CTLR SAID THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON 132.25. I INFORMED THEM THAT WE HAD JUST COME FROM 132.25 BUT THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO THEM. AT SOME TIME IN THE HDOF CONFUSION AND SWITCHING FREQS; WE NOTED OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC 2.5 MI AWAY ON TCASII AT 10000 FT MSL AND TURNED APPROX 20 DEGS L OF COURSE TO ENSURE SEPARATION. I BELIEVE THE TFC SHOWED AS A 'TA' ON TCASII. THE CAPT AND MYSELF COMMENTED THAT WE WERE SURPRISED THAT ATC HAD NOT POINTED OUT THE CONFLICTING TFC. THIS EVENT OCCURRED BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO RETURN TO 132.25. UPON RETURNING TO 132.25; THE CTLR IMMEDIATELY ASKED US OUR ALT. I STATED 10000 FT. WITH SOME URGENCY IN HIS VOICE HE TOLD US TO RETURN TO 9000 FT; PROBABLY DUE TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC WHICH BY THIS TIME WAS NOT A FACTOR. HE THEN ASKED WHO GAVE US 10000 FT AND THE FREQ CHANGE. I SAID THE PREVIOUS CTLR. BY THIS POINT; SO MUCH CONFUSION EXISTED THAT THE CAPT AND I COULD NOT BE SURE WHICH FREQ WE WERE ACTUALLY ON WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO MAINTAIN 10000 FT. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT REALIZE IT AT THE TIME; THERE WERE SOME ITEMS THAT DID NOT SEEM RIGHT. FIRST; THE FLT PLANNED RTE WAS FOR 9000 FT MSL AND WE WERE NOW AT 10000 FT MSL. SECOND; WE HAD JUST COME FROM 118.00 TO 132.25 SO WHY WOULD WE BE HANDED BACK TO 118.00. IN THAT MOMENT; WE WERE SIMPLY COMPLYING WITH ATC'S INSTRUCTIONS. MY CAPT AND I DISCUSSED THE EVENTS THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED AND WONDERED HOW WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN TO 10000 FT IF ATC ACTUALLY WANTED US AT 9000 FT. I HAD READ BACK THE ALT ASSIGNMENT (ALONG WITH THE FREQ CHANGE) AND SELECTED IT IN THE ALT SELECTOR. AFTER REVIEWING THE SIT; MY ONLY GUESS IS THAT MAYBE I ACKNOWLEDGED AN ALT AND FREQ CHANGE THAT WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO ANOTHER ACFT GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY WE WERE GETTING HANDED BACK TO 118.00 AND GIVEN 10000 FT; ALL POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION FOR A WBOUND ACFT. NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ATC THAT MY READBACK WAS INCORRECT OR THAT THE COMMAND WAS ACTUALLY FOR ANOTHER ACFT WAS RECEIVED; AS FAR AS I KNOW. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CTLR WAS NOT VIGILANT IN LISTENING TO MY READBACK OR THAT I SWITCHED FREQS BEFORE THE CTLR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ME. AS FOR THE REASON THAT ATC DID NOT POINT OUT TFC TO US MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WE WERE 'BTWN' FREQS AS A RESULT OF THE HDOF CONFUSION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE. THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE TCASII SYS DOING ITS INTENDED JOB EVEN THOUGH UNDER POSITIVE ATC IFR CTL. IN THE FUTURE I PLAN TO TREAT ALL ALTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THAT IN MY CLRNC/FLT PLAN WITH SUSPECT.,acr sf34 flc appar acknowledg dscnt clrnc anoth acft ; come into conflict possibl anoth acft . flc becom confus when acknowledg multipl freq chang doe not attempt confirm when clrnc 'seem suspect .

I said previou ctlr .

NO acknowledg atc that MY readback wa incorrect OR that command wa actual anoth acft wa receiv ; AS far AS I know . IT 'S possibl that ctlr wa not vigil IN listen TO MY readback OR that I switch freq befor ctlr opportun TO correct ME . AS reason that atc did not point out tfc TO US may have been that WE 'btwn ' freq AS A result OF hdof confus that wa take place . thi IS A good exampl OF tcasii sy do it intend job even though under posit atc ifr ctl .

WE SPOTTED THE TFC; BUT DID NOT CALL TFC IN SIGHT BEFORE ZBW GAVE THE B737 A CLB TO FL230. THE CAPT AND I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT GOING TO WORK AND BEFORE THE TCASII GAVE US AN ALERT WE STARTED A CLB AT THE SAME TIME THE TCASII ALERT TURNED INTO A RED RA WITH A CLB INSTRUCTION.

389,1500,5,I DEPARTED ORH ENRTE TO ASH. I HAD NOT FILED A FLT PLAN AND WAS FLYING PURELY VFR WITHOUT FLT FOLLOWING. UPON CLRING THE ORH AIRSPACE; MY FIRST CONCERN WAS TO BE SURE TO AVOID RESTR AREA R4102. DURING MY EARLIER FLT DOWN TO ORH FROM MHT; DURING WHICH I DID USE FLT FOLLOWING; BOSTON APCH HAD WARNED ME THAT R4102 WAS ACTIVE. UPON SAFELY PASSING R4102 I WAS ABOUT 4 MINS FLYING TIME FROM THE ASH AIRSPACE. I PICKED UP THE ASH ATIS AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WIND. WIND AT ORH HAD BEEN GUSTING TO 22 KTS AND IF IT WERE THAT STRONG AT ASH AND FROM THE SAME DIRECTION IT WOULD EXCEED MY PERSONAL XWIND COMFORT LEVEL. THE ASH ATIS; AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT; GARBLED THE WIND VELOCITY FIGURE; SOUNDING LIKE EITHER '8' OR '18' KTS. LISTENED TO 4 REPETITIONS OF THE ATIS STILL WITHOUT BEING SURE OF THE WIND VELOCITY. BY THAT TIME; I WAS ALMOST UPON THE ASH AIRSPACE. BECAUSE ASH IS VERY BUSY WITH TRAINING FLTS; IT CAN SOMETIMES TAKE A MIN OR 2 TO ESTABLISH COM WITH THEM. WHEN I DID; THEY TOLD ME TO ENTER A L BASE FOR THEIR RWY 14. BY THAT TIME; I KNEW I WAS MORE OR LESS OVER PEPPERELL SPORTS CENTER/ARPT (5M6) BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE ITS SHORT; NARROW RWY. TO MY HORROR; I SAW 1 PARACHUTE JUMPER DSNDING THROUGH MY ALT (ABOUT 1500 FT) TO MY R; AND ANOTHER GROUP OF THEM TO MY L. I WOULD ESTIMATE LATERAL SEPARATION OF ABOUT 1000 FT. I CONTINUED AND LANDED AT ASH. I THINK THE PRESENT LACK OF BROAD DISSEMINATION OF JUMPING INFO AT PEPPERELL IS DANGEROUS AND IS THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR MY FILING THIS FORM. THE ASH ATIS HAS A STANDARD WARNING PHRASE ABOUT JUMPING ACTIVITY AT PEPPERELL; BUT IT IS BROADCAST ALL THE TIME; WHETHER THERE IS JUMPING ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE OR NOT AT A GIVEN TIME; SO IS NOT VERY HELPFUL. BY THE TIME SOMEONE GETS TO THAT AREA COMING FROM THE S; HE/SHE IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE TALKING TO EITHER ASH TWR OR MHT APCH CTL; AND THUS UNABLE TO MONITOR THE PEPPERELL UNICOM. I ASSUME (ALTHOUGH I HAVE TRUTHFULLY NEVER HEARD ONE) THAT THE PEPPERELL JUMP PLANES BROADCAST ONE OR MORE WARNINGS AND A 'JUMPERS AWAY' STATEMENT. THE TROUBLE IS; IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED TO HEAR THEM WILL BE ABLE TO. I SUGGEST THAT JUMP INFO BE RELAYED IN REAL TIME TO AT LEAST THE ASH TWR AND PERHAPS ALSO MHT APCH CTL; WHO COULD THEN REBROADCAST THE INFO ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FREQS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ALL PLANES IN THE AREA WOULD GET THE INFO; IN THAT VIRTUALLY OF ALL THEM ARE OBLIGATED TO BE IN COM WITH EITHER MHT APCH OR ASH TWR. I KNOW THAT PEPPERELL IS NOT FORMALLY INSIDE EITHER MHT OR ASH AIRSPACE; BUT CAN'T SOMETHING LIKE THE ABOVE BE DONE BASED ON COMMON SENSE AND SAFETY EFFECTIVENESS? A VARIATION ON THE ABOVE SUGGESTION WOULD BE FOR THE JUMP PLANE TO BE GIVEN PERMISSION TO BROADCAST THE JUMP STATUS ON THE ASH TWR AND MHT APCH FREQS. I BELIEVE THIS IS DONE OVER NEAR ALBANY; NY; AND EVERYONE THEREFORE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. ANOTHER IDEA WOULD BE TO REVISE THE ASH ATIS TO STATE SOMETHING LIKE (WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE) 'JUMPING ACTIVITY WILL TAKE PLACE AT PEPPERELL SPORTS CENTER DURING THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF THIS ATIS BROADCAST; MONITOR PEPPERELL UNICOM WHEN IN AREA.' I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IN THE FUTURE; I WILL RELIGIOUSLY INQUIRE ON PEPPERELL UNICOM WHEN I AM ANYWHERE NEAR THEM; BUT IF SOMETHING IS NOT CHANGED; SOMEONE ELSE MAY HAVE A LAPSE LIKE MINE; AND SOMEONE COULD GET KILLED. I URGE THAT SOME IMPROVED PROC BE IMPLEMENTED. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THAT HE DID NOT CONTACT THE TWR REGARDING THE INCIDENT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BUSY. THERE ARE 2 TRAINING SCHOOLS ON THE FIELD AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVITY WITH INEXPERIENCED STUDENT PLTS. RPTR FEELS THIS IS AN INHERENTLY HAZARDOUS SIT; HIS OWN EXPERIENCE BEING AN EXAMPLE. HE IS AWARE OF PROCS IN OTHER AREAS WHICH ALERT PLTS TO ACTUAL JUMP ACTIVITY IN PROGRESS.

DUE TO THE HAZE AND OVCST CONDITIONS; WE COULDN'T DETERMINE WHAT IT WAS OR WHAT IT WAS DOING.

WE CONTINUED OUR R TURN AND STARTED AN IMMEDIATE DSCNT TO 1900 FT MSL TO ESCAPE THE SIT. AS WE GOT CLOSER WE SAW IT WAS A C172 AND HE WAS TURNING AND DSNDING TOWARD OUR POS.

395,800,1,BACKGROUND: SINCE A COUPLE OF EXPERIENCED CTLRS LEFT BEDFORD (BED) TWR; THE LEVEL OF MISCOM AND CONFUSION AT THE ARPT HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN PARTICULAR; THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS EXHIBITED BY THE CTLRS HAS DECREASED; INCREASING PLT WORKLOAD. INCIDENTS WHERE THE CTLR HAS HAD TO ASK THE ACFT ON FINAL OR DOWNWIND TO IDENT HIMSELF ARE NOW REGULAR OCCURRENCES. 'MANGLING' OF TAIL NUMBERS OCCURS DAILY. ON ONE FLT THE WEEK BEFORE THIS EVENT; WE WERE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR 3 DIFFERENT TAIL NUMBERS (XA; XB; XC -- ONLY OURS; XA WAS THAT OF AN ACFT IN THE PATTERN). IN THE PAST IN A GIVEN SIT; THE CTLRS WOULD GIVE A PREDICTABLE SET OF OPTIONS IF THEY COULD NOT APPROVE A REQUEST -- NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GUESS. THIS EVENT: WE RPTED #1 FOR TKOF AND REQUESTED TO REMAIN IN THE PATTERN FOR A TOUCH-AND-GO FOLLOWED BY A DEP TO THE N. WE WERE CLRED FOR IMMEDIATE TKOF (L TFC) IN FRONT OF A C172. NORMALLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF TIME FOR AN IMMEDIATE TKOF; BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE (UNTIL WE SPOKE WITH THE C172 PLT LATER THAT EVENING) THAT HE WAS 'EXPEDITING' FOR A SENECA IN TRAIL AND WAS NOT PLANNING TO SLOW UNTIL SHORT FINAL. HE CLOSED ON US AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO GAR (R TFC). (NO PROB YET.) HE 'MESSED UP' AND FOLLOWED US IN L TFC; SO HE SAW SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED. THE FREQ WAS CONGESTED SO WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COMMUNICATE UNTIL WE WERE ABEAM THE APCH END OF THE RWY. WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW A TOMAHAWK AHEAD ON DOWNWIND. WE WERE INITIALLY UNABLE TO IDENT HIM. WE DID SEE A DARK SHAPE (NO LIGHTS THAT WE COULD SEE) APPARENTLY 'OUTBOUND' ON FINAL WHO WAS WELL BELOW PATTERN ALT. WE ACTUALLY ASKED THE TWR IF OUR TFC WAS STILL OUTBOUND TO CONFIRM THIS. WE WERE OVERTAKING THIS TFC WHO WAS ABOUT 4 MI OUT FROM THE RWY SO WE BEGAN TO SLOW. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TWR TOLD US TO FOLLOW A CESSNA ON A 5 MI FINAL. (IN A SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THE CTLR SAID THAT HE TOLD US THAT WE MIGHT BE RESEQUENCED ON THE CESSNA.) IN EITHER CASE WE IDENTED THE CESSNA INBOUND AT THE OM; BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE TOMAHAWK COULD TURN INSIDE THE CESSNA; WE DECIDED THAT IF THEY DIDN'T COLLIDE WE WOULD FOLLOW THE TOMAHAWK. THE TOMAHAWK SEEMED TO 'TURN-ON-A-DIME' TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA AND WE MAINTAINED VISUAL CONTACT WITH BOTH ACFT AS WE TURNED FINAL. AT THAT TIME; THE TOMAHAWK AND WE WERE CLRED TO LAND AND TAXI BACK (IN THE PAST CTLRS WOULD GIVE THE OPTION OF DEPARTING THE PATTERN WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY WANTED). BECAUSE OF THE UNEXPECTED CLRNC; I LOOKED OVER TO THE L DOWNWIND TO SEE IF THERE WAS TFC SO THAT WE COULD REQUEST TO LEAVE THE PATTERN RATHER THAN LAND. AT THAT POINT I MUST HAVE LOST THE TOMAHAWK AND REFOCUSED ON THE CESSNA. WE CONTINUED INBOUND; AND ASKED THE CTLR HOW WE COULD SAFELY LEAVE THE PATTERN. HE NEVER REPLIED UNTIL ABOUT 1 MI OUT WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO GAR. THE CTLR HAD NOTICED THAT WE WERE ABOVE AND OVERTAKING THE TOMAHAWK. HE AND ANOTHER CTLR TOLD ME BY TELEPHONE AFTERWARD THAT WE WERE 'NOT THAT CLOSE;' BUT THE TOMAHAWK PLT RPTED IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE TWR THAT HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE TREADS ON OUR TIRES. I DID NOT SEE THE TOMAHAWK. I AM DISTURBED BECAUSE THE CONFUSION 'CAUSED' BY THE CTLR; THE SLOWER FLYING TOMAHAWK INVENTING A NEW (NON STANDARD) TFC PATTERN AND THE TIME OF DAY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE ME TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE TFC WITHOUT REALIZING IT. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF THE CTLR OR THE OTHER PLT; BUT STANDARD PROCS WOULD HAVE HELPED ME TO AVOID THIS SIT; WHILE INCREASED VIGILANCE ON MY PART WOULDN'T HAVE HURT EITHER. FORTUNATELY; WE ARE ALL ABLE TO LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

DUE TO THE LIGHTS ON THE HWY AND LIGHTS OF THE CITY; IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO VISUALLY SPOT THE ACFT. THE TFC SPOTTERS NEED TO BE AT 2000-2300 FT MSL WHEN THE RWY 29 PATTERN IS IN USE. BEDFORD'S CLASS D RUNS UP TO 2400 FT; BUT BOSTON APCH SEEMS TO RUN IT AT 2000 FT. THIS MAY BE WHY THE TWR KEEPS THE SPOTTERS DOWN LOW. ACFT IN THE LNDG PHASE OF FLT HAVE RIGHT-OF-WAY.

417,1000,1.5,A PIPER CHEROKEE 235; PLTED BY THE RPTR OF THIS SAFETY RPT; WAS CLRED TO ENTER A R DOWNWIND FOR RWY 23 AT BED; MA; BUT INSTEAD INADVERTENTLY INITIALLY SET UP FOR A L DOWNWIND. UPON INSISTENCE TO USE R DOWNWIND BY THE TWR CTLR; WHO APPEARED UNAWARE OF MY ACTUAL POS; I MADE AN UNINTENDED POOR DECISION TO CROSS IN FRONT OF DEPARTING TFC; ALONG THE UPWIND LEG. DEPARTING TFC; A PIPER WARRIOR; WAS CLOSE BUT NEVER ON A COLLISION COURSE AND WAS FULLY IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES. THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS DESCRIBED HERE. AT 9 MI SSW OF HANSCOM FIELD; HDG APPROX 030 DEGS; BOS APCH CTL CEASED RADAR SVCS AND ADVISED ME TO CONTACT HANSCOM TWR. DUE TO EXTREME CONGESTION ON THE TWR FREQ; THE INITIAL CALL TO HANSCOM TWR WAS MADE VERY BRIEF 'HANSCOM TWR; N-NUMBER; 7 MI SW; ATIS INFO.' TWR REPLIED; '...ENTER R DOWNWIND RWY 23.' AT THIS POINT; IN SPITE OF GREAT VISIBILITY AND CLR AFTERNOON SKIES; I COULD NOT SEE THE DEP END OF RWY 23. THE DEP END WAS OBSCURED BY TREES I WOULD LATER FIGURE OUT. I WAS NOT AWARE AT FIRST THAT I WAS ON THE L DOWNWIND SIDE OF THE EXTENDED CTRLINE. USING THE ARPT DIAGRAM OF THE TERMINAL PROC FOR ORIENTATION (REF 1) PROVIDED FURTHER CONFUSION AS I DID NOT REALIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT N IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE TOP OF THE PAGE. IT IS ALIGNED TO THE L OF THE PAGE. THEREFORE; I EXPECTED TO SEE RWY 5/23 IN A DIFFERENT POS RELATIVE TO THE TWR AND TERMINAL BUILDING THAT WERE VISIBLE TO ME. I AM NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH HANSCOM FIELD; HAVING BEEN THERE ONLY 3 OR 4 TIMES; ALWAYS UNDER IFR GUIDANCE TO THE RWY. NO TERRAIN FEATURES EXIST FOR ORIENTATION SW OF HANSCOM AS IT IS WOODED OVER A LARGE AREA. ADDITIONALLY; NO VOR OR ADF NAV IS PRESENT ON THE FIELD FOR DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION. BUT A LARGE FACTOR IN ME NOT TURNING N EARLY ON TO ENTER THE TFC PATTERN OF RWY 23 FROM THE W ON R DOWNWIND WAS WORSE THAN EXPECTED PLT FATIGUE. FOR SEVERAL PRECEDING NIGHTS; MINIMAL SLEEP WAS HAD. THERE WAS PRESENT ENOUGH INFO; COMPASS HDG OF 030 DEGS; TO REALIZE THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CTRLINE FOR R DOWNWIND. AT 3 MI FROM THE ARPT; STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE THE DEP END; I DID FIGURE OUT BASED ON HDG THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CTRLINE TO ENTER R DOWNWIND. BUT NOW A STEADY STREAM OF DEPARTING ACFT PREVENTED THE TURN TO THE N. AND THE TWR FREQ WAS SO BUSY THAT I WAS UNABLE TO REQUEST A L DOWNWIND UNTIL ABOUT 1 MI FROM THE DEP END. THE TWR CTLR; NOT ANTICIPATING MY ACTUAL POS; INSISTED ON A R DOWNWIND AS PREVIOUSLY CLRED. AT THIS POINT I DETERMINED; IN HASTE; THAT I COULD SQUEEZE BTWN A DEPARTING C152 AND AN IN-TRAIL PIPER WARRIOR. A BETTER PLAN; GIVEN A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT; WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO A 180 DEG TURN OUT OF THE AREA OR JUST ENTER THE L DOWNWIND; THUS NOT REQUIRING A MANEUVER BTWN DEPARTING TFC. UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT AT THAT MOMENT EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED FURTHER PLT/CTLR INTERACTION ON ALREADY CONGESTED FREQ. THE REMAINDER OF THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL BESIDE THE CONTINUED EXTREME FREQ CONGESTION. SEE THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM FOR FURTHER DETAIL. POSSIBLE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS; BESIDES HUMAN PERFORMANCE LESSONS WELL LEARNED BY THE RPTING PLT; ARE INCREASED CTLRS AND/OR AIRSPACE RESTRS AT EXTREMELY BUSY CLASS D ARPTS SUCH AT PAL-WAUKEE; TETERBORO; AND HANSCOM.

418,1800,1,A FLT OF 3 F16'S (X) WERE PROCEEDING STRAIGHT IN TO RWY 15 FOR AN OVERHEAD APCH; L BREAK; 1800 FT BREAK ALT. THERE WAS A B1900 (Y) COMMUTER THAT DEPARTED RWY 19 ON RWY HDG. THIS ACFT WAS TURNED R HDG 320 DEGS AND LEVEL 2000 FT ABOUT 3 MI SW OF THE ARPT. THE F16'S DID NOT BREAK L BUT TURNED W. THEY WERE ABOUT 1 MI W OF THE FIELD WHEN THEY ADVISED THEY COULDN'T BREAK L BECAUSE OF A CLOUD. THEY WERE HEADED DIRECTLY AT THE B1900 AND I GAVE THEM AN IMMEDIATE TURN AND CLB TO GET AWAY FROM THE COMMUTER. WE SPOKE WITH THE F16 FLT LEADER LATER AND ADVISED HE CAN'T JUST BREAK OFF HIS APCH AND TURN ANY WAY HE WANTS WITHOUT TELLING US. AT 350 KTS; IF HE TURNS IN AN UNEXPECTED DIRECTION; IT MAY CAUSE CONFLICTS VERY QUICKLY. THE PLT SAYS THAT HE TURNED R OUT OF THE PATTERN BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO STAY CLR OF CLOUD. HE SAID THE WX WAS BETTER TO THE W. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 456021: WX AT BTV RPTED AS 6000 FT BROKEN AND 6 MI VISIBILITY. CLRED FOR A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 15 AT BTV. SOMEWHERE BTWN 1-3 MI OFF OF THE APCH END AT 1800 FT MSL (GOING TO INITIAL) IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE BREAK COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED DUE TO A CLOUD DIRECTLY OVER THE FIELD AND E OF THE FIELD. WHILE DEVIATING TO THE W SLIGHTLY TO MAINTAIN CLR OF CLOUDS; A XMISSION TO TWR WAS MADE TO INFORM THAT THE OVERHEAD PATTERN COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED; AND REQUESTED VECTORS BACK TO RADAR. TWR GAVE AN IMMEDIATE L TURN TO 360 DEGS AND CLB TO 3000 FT. A COMMUTER B1900 RPTEDLY HAD TO REACT TO TCASII ADVISORIES AS WE DEVIATED 1/2 MI W AROUND THE CLOUD. TWR RPTS ALSO THAT LEGAL SEPARATION WAS MAINTAINED AND NO VISUAL CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED BTWN THE ACFT. MY COMMENTS: THE ATIS HAD NOT UPDATED PROPERLY. ACTUAL CONDITIONS OVERHEAD WERE ACTUALLY 2000 FT AND 3 MI. I WOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED AN OVERHEAD IF ATIS WAS CLOSE TO ACTUAL CONDITIONS. I QUESTION TCASII PRECISION IN A MANEUVERING ENVIRONMENT.

419,6500,0,ON MAR/XA/00; I WAS OPERATING AN LGA-MHT FLT. I WAS PNF. JUST PRIOR GDM VOR; I WENT OFF THE ATC FREQ TO GET THE ATIS FOR MHT. UPON RETURNING TO THE FREQ; THE FO (PNF) WAS TURNING TO THE OUTBOUND RADIAL FROM GDM. HE THEN REMARKED THAT ZBW WANTED US TO MAINTAIN OUR HDG PRIOR TO GDM AND PROMPTLY TURNED BACK TO IT. CTR OBSERVED THE OUTBOUND TURN AND INSTRUCTED US TO TURN BACK. WE ADVISED WE WERE DOING SO. CTR ALSO ADVISED US OF TFC WHICH WE OBSERVED ON TCASII. THERE WAS NO TA OR RA FROM THE SYS. THE FLT PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY TO MHT. ZBW CALLED US ON THE GND AT MHT AND SAID THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF SEPARATION WITH THE OTHER ACFT.

WE WERE ALREADY CLBING AND AT 9000 FT THE WARNING CHANGED TO 'MONITOR VERT SPD.' I LEVELED AT 9000 FT AND THE TCASII RPTED 'CLR OF CONFLICT.'

421,0,0,WE WERE LNDG ON RWY 27 IN BOSTON. THE WX WAS CLR; VFR; BUT WITH GUSTY WINDS. THE LNDG RESULTED IN A HIGH BOUNCE; FROM WHICH WE ELECTED TO GO AROUND. ALTHOUGH AN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE; THE TRANSITION TO THE GAR WENT WELL. HOWEVER; AS PER USUAL ZBW PROCS; ANOTHER ACFT (A SAAB 340) HAD DEPARTED RWY 22R; CREATING A CONVERGING CONFLICT WITH A MISSED APCH/GAR SIT OF RWY 27. AS WE COMMENCED THE GAR; BOS TWR IMMEDIATELY ISSUED US A TURN TO 140 DEGS. THIS REMINDED US OF THE FACT WE'D SEEN AND COMMENTED ON THE SAAB IN POS ON RWY 22R; AS WE APCHED RWY 27; AND THE POTENTIAL OF CONFLICT SHOULD WE MISS AND THEY TAKE OFF. WE COMMENCED AN ASSERTIVE L TURN AND CONTINUATION OF OUR CLB. ALTHOUGH NO TCASII ALERT TOOK PLACE (TOO LOW FOR ACTIVATION?) A QUICK GLANCE OF CONCERN TO THE TCASII SHOWED A TARGET NEARLY UNDER US BY A MERE 100 FT. THIS ADDED VIGOR TO OUR MANEUVER. WE ALSO ASKED THE TWR WHERE THE SAAB WAS -- THEY SAID IT WAS GOING STRAIGHT OUT AND NOT A FACTOR. SETTLED DOWN; WE MADE A NICE VISUAL APCH AND LNDG TO RWY 29. (AN AIRBUS A320 WAS ALSO ON A LAHSO APCH TO RWY 22L; HOLD SHORT OF RWY 27 -- IMAGINE IF THEY'D MISSED APCH; TOO!). OBVIOUSLY THE GAR WAS UNUSUAL AND CONCERNING TO THE PAX; SOME COMMENTED THAT THEY'D SEEN THE OTHER ACFT AND IT WAS CLOSE. QUITE A FEW WERE ALSO AND UNDERSTANDABLY SCARED. WE MADE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP PA ANNOUNCEMENTS. SUMMARY: FROM A PLT'S POINT OF VIEW; THE BOUNCE AND GAR; ALTHOUGH NOT COMMON; WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WELL UNDER CTL. OUR MAIN CONCERN CAME FROM THE CLOSE VICINITY OF THE ACFT DEPARTING OFF RWY 22R; AND THE FACT THAT THE SEQUENCE OF RWY 27 LNDGS WITH RWY 22R DEPS WILL RESULT IN 'TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT' SITS; SHOULD THERE BE A RWY 27 GAR. THESE SITS NEED BE RESEQUENCED TO CONSIDER GARS; TOO; OR ELSE IT SEEMS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME!' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR 469601 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE ACFT WAS TURNED SO THAT IT DID NOT PASS RWY 22L; MISSING THE SAAB BY ABOUT 1000 FT HORIZ. THE CAPT HAD TAKEN OVER THE CTLS AND MADE A TIGHT TURN TO THE ASSIGNED HDG OF 140 DEGS TO KEEP THE FLT AWAY FROM THE SAAB WHICH WAS ON A RWY HDG OF 220 DEGS BELOW THEM. THE FO RPTED THAT THIS PROC HAS BEEN IN USE FOR SOME TIME AT BOS. HE STATED THAT THE PIC DID TALK WITH THE FACILITY CHIEF; BUT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED. THE CAPT ALSO TURNED IN A COMPANY RPT; BUT SO FAR AS HE KNOWS DID NOT RPT THIS TO THE UNION. THE FO WAS COUNSELED TO DO SO. ONE PROB WITH THIS PROC IS THAT THE 2 ACFT WERE ON SEPARATE FREQS; THE SAAB ON 128.8 AND THE B727 ON 119.1. WITH DEP JET TFC; THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT ON A NORMAL GAR FROM RWY 27 AND A DEP FROM RWY 22L/R AS THE JET (UNLESS VERY LIGHT) WOULD BE WELL UNDER THE FLT PATH OF A GAR ACFT FROM RWY 27. THE OTHER PROB IS THAT THE TURBOPROPS; LIKE THE SAAB; ARE LIFTING OFF SOONER; CLBING OUT ON RWY HDG AND DOES CREATE A CONFLICT AREA WITH ANY ACFT ON THE GAR FROM RWY 27.,A near nmac occur AT end OF rwi 27 when A b727-200 perform A gar nearli hit A dep sf340 ON initi clb off rwi 22r AT bo ; MA .

423,37000,25,I WAS WORKING SECTOR 2 AT ZBW. THERE WERE MORE THAN 20 ACFT IN THE SECTOR; TSTMS IN THE VICINITY OF ENE VORTAC; WX RERTES FOR ATL; CLT; AND EWR; ALONG WITH IN TRAIL RESTRS FOR THESE AND OTHER ARPTS. AT APPROX XA05Z MY SUPVR ADVISED THAT THE NEXT SECTOR WOULD NOT TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL ACFT. I BEGAN ISSUING VECTORS; ALT CHANGES; TO KEEP ACFT IN MY AIRSPACE; AND SET UP HOLDING. ACR X WAS ONE OF 4 ACFT IN TRAIL FOR JFK AND APCHING THE SECTOR BOUNDARY. I ISSUED ALL 4 ACFT RADAR VECTORS HDG 180 DEGS INTO AN ADJOINING SECTOR THAT WAS NOT AS BUSY AS DIRECTED BY MY SUPVR. AUTOMATED HDOF HAD BEEN INITIATED TO THE FIRST SECTOR; SO I REINITIATED THE HDOFS FOR ALL 4 ACFT TO THE ADJOINING SECTOR. THE COMPUTER INPUT FOR ACR X WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND CONTINUED TO 'FLASH' TO THE ORIGINAL SECTOR. I DID NOT NOTICE THIS ERROR. SUBSEQUENTLY; THE ORIGINAL SECTOR UNEXPLAINABLY ACCEPTED THE HDOF ON ACR X. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD REINITIATED THE HDOF TO THE ADJACENT SECTOR SUCCESSFULLY; AND THAT; THEREFORE; HE HAD ACCEPTED THE HDOF. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR DROPPED THE DATA BLOCK FROM MY DISPLAY PRIOR TO MY ISSUING A FREQ CHANGE TO THE ACFT; AND I FAILED TO NOTICE AND CORRECT THE SIT. THE ACFT FLEW FOR 8-10 MINS THROUGH THE NEXT SECTOR; WITH ONLY A LIMITED DATA BLOCK DISPLAYED; WHICH THE NEXT CTLR NEVER NOTICED. THE NEXT CTLR VECTORED ANOTHER ACFT INTO ACR X. AT XA15Z ACR X RPTED A TCASII CLB ON MY FREQ. I DETERMINED THE ACFT'S POS; THAT SEPARATION HAD BEEN RE-ESTABLISHED; THEN CHANGED THE ACFT TO THE PROPER FREQ. THE PROB WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE TO REINITIATE THE HDOF TO THE CORRECT SECTOR. THIS WAS AFFECTED BY VERY HIGH TFC VOLUME AND COMPLEXITY. OTHER ASSOCIATED SYS PROBS THAT OCCURRED AFFECTING THE OUTCOME: POOR FLOW CTL; NO WARNING OF A 'RED SECTOR;' SUPVR NOT ASSIGNING A HDOF CTLR AS EXTRA HELP; UNEXPLAINED ACTION OF THE CTLR ACCEPTING THE HDOF AFTER STATING THEY WOULD TAKE NO MORE ACFT AND THEN NOT SAYING OR DOING ANYTHING WHEN THE ACFT FLEW AROUND HIS SECTOR; FAILURE OF THE CTLR AND SUPVR TO NOTICE A LIMITED DATA BLOCK FOR 8-10 MINS IN HIS AIRSPACE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. THANKFULLY; TCASII WORKS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 472329: ON MAY/XA/00 I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS AT SECTOR 2. TFC MGMNT UNIT HAD WX RERTES IN FOR ATL AND EWR SENDING BOTH RTES OVER BOS. THIS; IN ADDITION TO THE JFK ARRS; PHL AND SOUTHERN EAST COAST BOUND ACFT THAT ARE OVER BOS. WE WERE ISSUING THE RERTES AND PROVIDING 20 MI IN TRAIL TO ATL; IAD; ALL TFC RTED OVER CMK AND IN TRAIL FOR JFK. IN EFFECT; TFC MGMNT UNIT HAD EVERYTHING FUNNELING DOWN TO 1 SPOT TO GO E AROUND AN EBOUND WX SYS. WHEN THE WX CLOSED IN; THE DOOR GOT SLAMMED AND SECTOR 46; OVER BOS; SHUT US OFF WITH NO NOTICE. WE HAD 20 SOME ACFT WITH NO PLACE TO GO. THE RADAR CTLR BEGAN VECTORING TO CONTAIN THE ACFT N OUR SECTOR. I BEGAN WORKING TO TRY TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT THEM. THE SECTOR TO OUR SE; SECTOR 17; VOLUNTEERED TO OFFLOAD THE JFK TFC. THE RADAR CTLR TURNED THE FIRST 4 ACFT TO 180 DEG HDGS. THE FIRST 3 WERE FLASHED TO SECTOR 17; THE LAST WAS STILL FLASHING TO SECTOR 46. AS SECTOR 17 TOOK THE FIRST 3; THEY WERE SWITCHED. SECTOR 46 ACCEPTED THE HDOF ON THE 4TH ACR X; ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOW HEADED INTO SECTOR 17. THE RADAR CTLR WAS NOW ISSUING HOLDING TO ACFT AND I WAS UPDATING THE DATABASE TO OFFLOAD THE EWR ACFT TO THE LOW SECTOR. NEITHER ONE OF US NOTICED THAT ACR X WAS HANDED OFF TO THE WRONG SECTOR AND HAD NOT BEEN FREQ CHANGED. 7 MINS LATER; THE ACR X RPTED CLBING ON A TCASII RESOLUTION. THE ACR X; WHOM WAS NOT DISPLAYED ON SECTOR 17; HAD CROSSED BACK OVER ACR Y. EVEN AT THAT POINT WE XFERRED COMS AND DID NOT REALIZE WE HAD ENTERED SECTOR 17 WITHOUT A HDOF. TFC MGMNT DID NOTHING TO ASSIST US AS THE TFC SIT DETERIORATED. THEY PUT EVERYONE DOWN ONE RTE; BUT BECAUSE EACH RESTR WAS ISSUED SEPARATELY THEY FAILED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE OVERLOADING ONE SECTOR. EVEN AFTER THE SECTOR OVERLOAD SOFTWARE ALERTED THEM THEY FAILED TO MONITOR THE SIT AND TAKE ACTION.

426,2500,4,THIS WAS A TRAINING FLT (BFR) THAT WAS BEING CONDUCTED BY ME. MY STUDENT; A PVT-INST RATED PLT WAS FLYING THE AIRPLANE ON THE L SIDE. I WAS SEATED ON THE R. WE DEPARTED RWY 23 AT BEDFORD WITH THE INTENT TO HEAD TOWARDS OUR PRACTICE AREA NW OF THE FIELD 12 NM AWAY. WE MADE A NORMAL TKOF AND CLBOUT TO THE PRACTICE AREA. VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AT THE TIME; ALTHOUGH WE WERE FLYING INTO THE SUN. AS WE CONTINUED OUR CLBOUT THROUGH 2500 FT (ESTIMATED); MY STUDENT OBSERVED TFC OFF OF OUR L SIDE. MY STUDENT TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TURNING AND CLBING TO THE R. THE DASH 8 ACFT TURNED AWAY AND TO THEIR R. DURING OUR CLBOUT MY STUDENT AND I HAD OUR ATTN OUTSIDE THE AIRPLANE. HOWEVER; BECAUSE WE WERE CLBING AND THE DASH 8 WAS DSNDING AT HIGH SPD MY STUDENT WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE OTHER ACFT UNTIL IT WAS IN CLOSE PROX. MY STUDENT'S ACTIONS WERE IMMEDIATE AND DELIBERATE AND WE MADE A STEEP BANK AWAY FROM THE TFC. AT THE CLOSEST POINT I ESTIMATE OUR DISTANCE TO BE 500 FT FROM THE OTHER ACFT. THE DASH 8 SPD AT THE TIME HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY ME TO BE IN EXCESS OF 150 KTS. OUR SPD AT THE TIME WAS BTWN 75 KTS AND 80 KTS. NO TA WAS NOTED BY ME TO HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO US BY THE TWR. WE WERE UNAWARE OF THE TFC CONFLICT UNTIL THE POINT WHEN WE SAW AND AVOIDED THE TFC. IN MY OPINION; THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS OR PRECAUTIONS THAT MY FLT COULD HAVE TAKEN; OR I COULD HAVE TAKEN TO AVOID THE SIT. I FEEL THAT DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO SCAN FOR TFC; BECAUSE OF THE CLB ATTITUDE WE WERE IN; IT WAS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT US TO SEE THE TFC ANY SOONER; ESPECIALLY WITH THE DASH 8 DSNDING NOSE LOW AT HIGH VELOCITY.,pa28 instructor plt requir TO take evas action depart bed arpt . thi wa A train flt ( bfr ) that wa be conduct BY ME .

427,8000,0,THE CENTURION DEPARTED NEWPORT ARPT AND I ISSUED CLB TO 10000 FT. 2 OR 3 MINS LATER; THE PA31 DEPARTED PROVIDENCE FLT PLANNED VIA THE SAME RTE AND ALT. I ISSUED CLB TO 8000 FT AND PUT BOTH ACFT ON PARALLEL HEADINGS. MY WORKLOAD WAS LIGHT AND I BELIEVED I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MONITOR THESE 2 ACFT. APPARENTLY THE SCOPE WAS SET UP ON A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RANGE THAN WHAT I WOULD BE ACCUSTOMED TO AND I BELIEVED I HAD AT LEAST 5 MI BTWN THE 2 ACFT WHILE THEY WERE ON PARALLEL HEADINGS. I SAW THE RADAR PLOT LATER AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONLY 3.5 MI BTWN THEM. AS THE ACFT CLBED NWBOUND AND BELIEVING I HAD A CUSHION ON 2 MI I INSTRUCTED THE CENTURION TO RESUME HIS OWN NAV DIRECT TO PUT VOR (A COURSE THAT WOULD CONVERGE WITH THE HEADING OF THE PA31) LEAVING THE ASSIGNED ALT OF THE NAVAJO (8000 FT). MEANWHILE I STARTED TO RECEIVE A HDOF OF A SBOUND PA31 AT 8000 FT THAT WOULD BE A CONFLICTION WITH THE PA31 I WAS ALREADY WORKING; SO I TOOK A MOMENT OR TWO TO DECIDE HOW I WOULD HANDLE THE SIT. DURING THIS TIME; THE CENTURION LEFT 8000 FT AND TURNED TOWARD PUT AND THE PA31. IF THERE REALLY HAD BEEN 5 MI BTWN THEM TO START EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE; BUT AS THERE WAS ONLY 3.5 MI; I LOST STANDARD SEPARATION VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE C210 BEGIN HIS TURN TOWARD PUT. WHAT I DID WRONG: ISSUED A TURN LEAVING THE ASSIGNED ALT OF THE OTHER ACFT RATHER THAN ONE 1000 FT ABOVE IT; NEGLECTING TO MONITOR BOTH ACFT TO ENSURE THE SIT WAS DEVELOPING AS INTENDED; ALLOWED A POTENTIAL CONFLICT TO DISTRACT ME FROM AN IMMINENT ONE; NEGLECTING TO SET UP THE SCOPE ACCORDING TO MY NORMAL PRACTICE AND THEREBY CREATING CONFUSION AS TO SCALE; I FORGOT THAT I COULD HAVE TURNED THE CENTURION TOWARD BAF (THE NEXT FIX OUT OF MY AIRSPACE PER LOA WITH Y90 TRACON) THEREBY ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING LATERAL SEPARATION WITH THE PA31. I SETTLED ON A COURSE OF ACTION AND THEN CLOSED MY MIND TO ALTERNATIVES THAT WOULD HAVE VOIDED PROBS.,dep ctlr fail TO maintain legal separ btwn A cessna 210 A piper pa31 clbing out 2 differ arpt but parallel each other ON same flt plan rte . centurion depart newport arpt I issu clb TO 10000 ft. 2 OR 3 min later ; pa31 depart provid flt plan via same rte alt .

428,800,5,INITIALLY I WAS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THIS; HOWEVER; I FEEL THAT THE TWR WORKING SPLIT FREQS (ONE FREQ FOR HELIS AND TFC/PHOTO FIXED WING AND ONE FOR AIRLINE ARRS AND DEPS SIMULTANEOUSLY) MAY BE A PROB AT TIMES. I WAS FLYING A BELL HELI OVER FENWAY PARK AREA ON A 1500 FT OR 2000 FT AND BELOW CLRNC FOR PHOTO WORK TO THE W OF THE ARPT. THERE WERE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND WITH VARYING VISIBILITY. NORMALLY; WE OPERATE THE HELIS 1000 FT AND BELOW. I WAS WORKING HIGHER FOR A PARTICULAR SHOT. ONCE COMPLETE; I REQUESTED THE TOBIN RTE FOR A NE DEP. I RECEIVED AN APPROVAL; QUICKLY FOR THE RTE. I HAD SOME CONCERN; AS I COULD HEAR THE CTLR'S VERY BUSY SIDE OF HER CONVERSATION WORKING THE OTHER FREQ AT THE SAME TIME AND EARLIER THEY HAD BEEN ARRIVING (TURBOPROPS) ON THE RWY 15R APCH AND CIRCLE DOWN THE HARBOR; LAND ON RWY 4L TO THE NE. SHE WAS VERY QUICK WITH 'APPROVED AS REQUESTED;' NOT MENTIONING ANYTHING ABOUT MY ALT. I CALLED BACK TO CONFIRM WITH ATC THAT I WAS GOING OUTBOUND ON THE TOBIN RTE. I THEN RECEIVED AN 'APPROVED AS REQUESTED; DSND TO 800 FT FOR THE TOBIN RTE.' WHILE DSNDING; I SWITCHED SOME FREQS FOR THE TRIP OUTBOUND ON THE SECOND RADIO. UPON REACHING THE START OF THE TOBIN RTE AT 800 FT AND ABOUT 1 MI FROM XING THE RWY 15R APCH COURSE; JUST WHERE THE TURBOPROPS START MAKING THEIR R TURNS VISUALLY DOWN THE HARBOR FOR RWY 4L; I LOOKED AT MY 1 O'CLOCK POS AND ABOUT 1 MI AND A TURBOPROP WAS MAKING HIS R TURN DOWN THE HARBOR. ALTHOUGH A SURPRISING SIGHT; BECAUSE THE TWR HAD MADE NO MENTION OF THE TFC; NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY. I CONTINUED OUT THE TOBIN RTE XING THE RWY 15R COURSE WITHOUT INCIDENT. WHILE XING I SAW DISTANT; 10 MI OR SO; LIGHTS OF ANOTHER ACFT FOR THE SAME APCH. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO INCIDENT THERE; I DO FEEL I WAS GETTING SECOND RATE ATTN TO MY OP WITH WHATEVER TIME THE CTLR HAD LEFT OVER WHILE SHE WAS WORKING THE OTHER MUCH BETTER FREQ. 1) AFTER I RECONFIRMED MY RTE OUTBOUND; I WAS THEN TOLD TO DSND TO A LOWER ALT. 2) I WAS NEVER ALERTED TO INBOUND TFC ON THE RWY 15R CIRCLE TO RWY 4L APCH. AGAIN NO INCIDENT; BUT WHAT ABOUT NEXT TIME? I FEEL WHENEVER EITHER FREQ GETS BUSY; ANOTHER CTLR SHOULD TAKE ONE. IF IT'S BUSY ENOUGH TO BE CLASS B AIRSPACE; THEN IT SHOULD BE STAFFED TO THAT LEVEL.

429,4000,5,WHAT REALLY CAUSED THIS PROB: 1) ATC/SYS DEMANDS THAT REQUIRE TURBOPROPS TO BE BELOW ALT SO FAR FROM JFK. ACR ACFT HAVE NO BUSINESS THIS LOW AND FAST IN AREAS THAT ARE SO HEAVILY FLOWN BY GA ACFT. THE PLT GROUP HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS BEFORE! 2) SPECIFIC TO THIS SIT WAS A VFR ACFT FLYING AT AN IFR ALT; NOT COMMUNICATING WITH ATC; FLT VISIBILITY 3-5 MI IN TYPICAL SUMMER HAZE.

HE DROPPED HIM IN FROM ABOVE US. WE RAN INTO HIS WAKE WHICH VIOLENTLY ROLLED OUR DASH. I CLICKED OFF THE AUTOPLT AND PULLED UP (CLBED TO 3200 FT). THE CTLR ASKED US OUR SPD. WE TOLD HIM WE SLOWED IT BACK TO GET MORE SPACE BTWN US AND THE B767 AND THAT WE JUST GOT HAMMERED WITH HIS WAKE. HE SEEMED MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BACK THINGS UP ON FINAL.

432,1500,3,THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL ON APCH INTO MVY. APCHING MVY THE WX WAS OBTAINED VIA ATIS AND WAS RPTED AS CLR SKIES 10 MI VISIBILITY WINDS 310 DEGS AT 4 KTS ALTIMETER 29.99. UPON REACHING THE ARPT THE WX HAD CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A 700 FT OVCST LAYER. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR MVY. THE DECISION TO DO THE ILS TO RWY 24 WAS AGREED UPON BY BOTH THE CAPT AND MYSELF. THIS APCH SET UP AND BRIEFED WELL BEFORE REACHING THE ARPT. BEFORE REACHING THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OF MVY IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT MVY WAS VERY BUSY JUST BY THE AMOUNT OF RADIO TFC ON APCH CTL (IT WAS JUL/SAT/00). WE WERE VECTORED TO AND WERE CLRED FOR THE ILS RWY 24; WHICH WE DID. JUST PRIOR TO AND BEFORE REACHING THE FINAL APCH FIX (FAF) WE WERE HANDED OFF TO AND TOLD TO CONTACT MVY TWR. BECAUSE OF RADIO TFC SATURATION WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT TWR CTL AS INSTRUCTED. JUST AFTER REACHING THE FAF/GS INTERCEPT AND WHILE DSNDING ON THE GS WE RECEIVED A TA ALERT ON THE TCASII. IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY I ARRESTED MY DSCNT ON THE GS. THE CAPT ACQUIRED A HIGH WING CESSNA IN FRONT OF AND BELOW US IN THE ILS APCH CORRIDOR. TO CONTINUE THE DSCNT ON THE GS WOULD HAVE AT THE VERY LEAST RESULTED IN A NEAR MISS AND AT THE VERY WORST A MIDAIR COLLISION. AS PF I ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH. IN THE 10-15 SECONDS THAT HAD ELAPSED FROM OUR HDOF FROM APCH TO TWR WE WERE VERY BUSY BOTH FLYING AND VISUALLY ACQUIRING OUR TA. AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT TWR BECAUSE OF RADIO TFC SATURATION WE DID. BECAUSE I HAD ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH THE CAPT CHKED IN WITH MVY TWR; 'LTT WITH YOU ILS RWY 24 GOING MISSED APCH.' WE PROCEEDED TO THE MISSED APCH AND DID THE PUBLISHED MISSED APCH. AT NO TIME PRIOR TO THIS DID WE CANCEL IFR NOR ACCEPT A VISUAL APCH. UPON OUR CHK IN WITH TWR THAT WE WERE GOING MISSED APCH WE WERE QUERIED AS TO WHY? THEY WERE INFORMED THAT WE HAD VISUALLY ACQUIRED TFC IN THE APCH CORRIDOR AND IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY HAD ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH. WE REQUESTED FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND RECEIVED VECTORS BACK TO THE ILS RWY 24 WHICH WE DID AND LANDED AT MVY. IN CONCLUSION I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE CESSNA THAT WAS IN OUR APCH CORRIDOR WAS ON A SPECIAL VFR CLRNC BECAUSE OF THE 700 FT CEILING. MY DECISION TO GO MISSED APCH WAS APPROPRIATE AND IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY CALLED FOR.,FO OF A learjet ; lr60 made miss apch IN respons TO A tcasii TA subsequ observ OF A cessna parallel TO hi il apch cours insid OF final apch fix . flt wa unev until ON apch into mvi . apch mvi WX wa obtain via ati wa rpted AS clr ski 10 MI visibl wind 310 deg AT 4 kt altimet 29.99 . upon reach arpt WX chang significantli TO A 700 FT ovcst layer .

433,7000,5,WE WERE A REGULARLY SCHEDULED AIRLINE TRIP FROM BURLINGTON; VT; TO CHICAGO; IL (ORD). ACFT WAS B737-300 WITH TCASII AND FMS. WX WAS VFR AT ARPT WITH AN OVCST DECK 5000-8000 FT MSL. TKOF CLRNC WAS RWY 15 INCLUDED TURN R TO 190 DEG HDG CLB TO 10000 FT. AFTER TKOF DEP CTL GAVE US (X) TURN R DIRECT WATERTOWN VOR (ATR). WHILE IMC PASSING 8000 FT BURLINGTON DEP CTL TOLD US 'DSND TO 7000 FT.' JUST THEN OUR TCASII DISPLAYED ANOTHER ACFT (Y) TO OUR R BUT VERY CLOSE (WITHIN 4 MI). OUR RATE OF CLB (2000 FPM) TOOK US THROUGH 8000 FT TO APPROX 8300 FT. THE COPLT (PNF) ACKNOWLEDGE THE DSCNT INSTRUCTION BUT ASKED IF INSTRUCTIONS WERE STILL VALID SINCE WE WERE ABOVE 8000 FT. WE THEN GOT A TCASII PAINT OF INTRUDING ACFT (Y) AND A TA. AT 8200 FT WE BROKE OUT ON TOP OF CLOUDS IN VMC (VISIBILITY 20 MI). WE NEVER SAW THE OTHER ACFT. DEP SAID YES; THEY WANTED US BACK DOWN TO 7000 FT. WE DSNDED INTO CLOUDS TO 7000 FT AFTER VERIFYING TCASII DISPLAYED SEPARATION INCREASING. I (PF) OBTAINED A PHONE NUMBER AND NAME TO CONTACT TO DISCUSS EVENTS. AFTER LNDG CONTACT WITH BURLINGTON DEP CTL SUPVR VERIFIED EVENTS. HE SAID THE CTLR HAD BEEN FORTHCOMING AND A REVIEW OF THE TAPE; SHOWED VERT SEPARATION OF 500 FT AND 1.72 MI HORIZ. THE CTLR WHO WORKED THE EVENT WAS OFF THE SCOPE AND THAT THIS WAS A 'FLT EVENT.'

434,3800,27,WE WERE IFR DSNDING THROUGH 4000 FT TO 3000 FT WHEN ATC ADVISED US THAT WE HAD TFC ('POP-UP') CLBING OUT OF 3200 FT AND TO LEVEL AT 4000 FT. WE CLBED BACK TO 4000 FT AND LEVELED; AND WERE TOLD TO MAKE A TURN OF 50 DEGS TO THE R TO AVOID THE TFC. AS WE ENTERED THE TURN; WE GOT AN RA ON OUR TCASII ('CLB'). I STARTED A CLBING TURN AND FOLLOWED THE TCASII COMMANDS. (WE NEVER GOT A TA FIRST.) WHEN WE SHOWED THE TURN RATE AND CLB ('MONITOR VERT SPD') A SECOND RA APPEARED TO OVERLAY AND OBSCURE THE FIRST RA. WHEN WE LOOKED OUT THE WINDSHIELD; I OBSERVED THE FIRST RA TFC APCHING AT ABOUT 300 FT BELOW AND 12 O'CLOCK POS. JUST AS THE FIRST ACFT STARTED TO BECOME OBSCURED BY OUR ACFT'S NOSE; I SPOTTED A SECOND ACFT AT 12:30 O'CLOCK POS AND APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER. (OUR ACFT WAS ROLLING OUT OF A TURN AND THE HORIZON WAS OBSCURED. ANY BANK ANGLE WOULD DISTORT THE ACTUAL RELATIVE POS.) UNABLE TO POSITIVELY IDENT RELATIVE ALT AND CLOSURE RATE; I MADE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION TO TURN SHARPLY BACK TO THE L (IN THE DIRECTION OF ORIGINAL TRACK). I WAS ALSO INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE FIRST ACFT HAD JUST DISAPPEARED BELOW THE NOSE OF OUR ACFT AND WAS STILL AN RA TARGET ON OUR TCASII. (I WAS UNABLE TO DSND). AS THE SECOND ACFT DISAPPEARED BELOW OUR ACFT; WE RECEIVED A TCASII MESSAGE 'CLR OF CONFLICT.' THIS WAS CLRLY A RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT WITH THE FIRST ACFT; AND NOT THE SECOND ACFT. EVEN THOUGH THE TCASII DISPLAYED 2 RED RA TARGETS AT THE SAME TIME; IT NEVER GAVE COMMANDS TO AVOID A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE SECOND RA TARGET; OR THAT WE WERE 'CLR OF (SECOND) CONFLICT.' THE CTLR NEVER ADVISED US OF THE SECOND ACFT'S POS OR ALT; AND BY ISSUING THE 50 DEG TURN TO THE R HE POSITIONED OUR ACFT DIRECTLY BTWN 2 ACFT THAT WERE CONVERGING VERTLY WITH US IN THE MIDDLE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE TURN CAUSED THE TCASII TO BECOME DISORIENTED HORIZLY FROM THE 2 TARGETS.,flc OF AN ltt dsnding request BY apch ctl TO hold alt turn . right after which they took evas action IN respons TO A tcasii RA then subsequ A second action IN respons TO A second tcasii RA . WE ifr dsnding through 4000 FT TO 3000 FT when atc advis US that WE tfc ( 'pop-up ' ) clbing out OF 3200 FT TO level AT 4000 ft. WE clbed back TO 4000 FT level ; told TO make A turn OF 50 deg TO R TO avoid tfc . AS WE enter turn ; WE got AN RA ON tcasii ( 'clb ' ) . I start A clbing turn tcasii command . ( WE never got A TA first . ) when WE show turn rate clb ( 'monitor vert spd ' ) A second RA appear TO overlay obscur first RA . when WE look out windshield ; I observ first RA tfc apch AT about 300 FT below 12 o'clock po . just AS first acft start TO becom obscur BY acft 'S nose ; I spot A second acft AT 12:30 o'clock po appear TO BE somewhat higher . ( acft wa roll out OF A turn horizon wa obscur . ani bank angl would distort actual rel po . ) unabl TO posit ident rel alt closur rate ; I made A split second decis TO turn sharpli back TO L ( IN direct OF origin track ) . I wa also influenc BY fact that first acft just disappear below nose OF acft wa still AN RA target ON tcasii . ( I wa unabl TO dsnd ) . AS second acft disappear below acft ; WE receiv A tcasii messag 'clr OF conflict . ' thi wa clrli A respons TO conflict first acft ; not second acft . even though tcasii display 2 red RA target AT same time ; IT never gave command TO avoid A collis cours second RA target ; OR that WE 'clr OF ( second ) conflict . ' ctlr never advis US OF second acft 'S po OR alt ; BY issu 50 deg turn TO R HE posit acft directli btwn 2 acft that converg vertli US IN middl .

439,4000,6,I WAS PROVIDING OJT TRAINING TO A RECENTLY XFERRED CTLR ON APCH/DEP CTL. THE TRAINEE ALSO HAD APPROX 18 YRS ATC EXPERIENCE. ACR X B727 DEPARTED RWY 29; RWY HDG; CLBING TO 3000 FT. ACR CHKED IN 'OUT OF 2000 FT FOR 3000 FT.' HE WAS ASSIGNED 8000 FT AND TURNED DIRECT MANCHESTER (MHT -- THE DEST -- A VERY SHORT FLT) APPROX 240 DEG HDG. I HAD BEEN WATCHING A PRIMARY TARGET (NO XPONDER) FOR A FEW MI THAT WAS NOW 6 NM DUE W OF PWM EBOUND. I INSTRUCTED THE TRAINEE TO 'ISSUE THE TFC.' THE TFC WAS ISSUED WITH ACR X INSTRUCTED TO 'STAY ON RWY HDG.' THE PLT RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE HDG 270 DEGS AND ASKED IF THAT WOULD BE OK. AT FIRST THE TRAINEE SAID 270 DEGS WOULD AVOID THE TFC; THEN REALIZED IT WOULD BE TOO CLOSE AND TURNED ACR BACK TO 290 DEGS; THEN RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT LESS THAN 1/2 MI 'HDG RIGHT AT US AT OUR ALT (4000 FT).' THE PLT QUESTIONED HOW CLOSE THE TFC CAME TO THEM AND ASKED WHAT ALT WE SHOWED ON THE TFC. WE TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO XPONDER; NO ALT. WE TRACKED THE PRIMARY TARGET TO A SMALL ARPT IN NORTHERN MAINE. BEFORE LNDG; THE PLT ASKED BANGOR APCH FOR A XPONDER CHK (HIS FIRST CONTACT WITH ATC SINCE DEPARTING CONNECTICUT). THE PLT CALLED US ON THE PHONE AND ADVISED THAT HE PASSED OVER PWM AT 5500 FT (HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN TOLD THAT '3 AIRLINE PLTS WILL TESTIFY YOU WERE AT 4000 FT'). HE FURTHER SAID HE WAS MONITORING THE ATC FREQ AND 'THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT ME AFTER I SAW THE B727 GO BY.' WHY THE PLT MONITORED THE FREQ AND NEVER CALLED US IS BEYOND ME. WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED AN NMAC AND MAYBE WORSE. IF THE ATC SVC IS THERE; USE IT! IT'S LESS WORKLOAD ON ATC TO TRACK AN ACFT AND GIVE AN ALTIMETER THAN CONSTANTLY BE ISSUING TFC 'TYPE AND ALT UNKNOWN.' I SPOKE WITH THE ACR PLT ON THE PHONE AND TOLD HIM THE PRIMARY TARGET WAS IN AN AREA WHERE THE ONLY ALT HE COULD BE AT; AND BE LEGAL; WAS 1500 FT AND BELOW; BUT I HAD THE TRAINEE ISSUE THE TFC ANYWAY 'BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.' MY TECHNIQUE; WHICH I RECOMMEND; IS TO ADD PHRASEOLOGY 'NO XPONDER' WHEN MAKING A CALL TO A TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT. THE PLT LIKED THE IDEA BECAUSE THEY (LIKE ME; WHEN I JUMP SEAT) INITIALLY LOOK AT THE TCASII TO BETTER CORRELATE THE TFC RELATIVE TO THE ACFT. ADDING 'NO XPONDER' GETS EVERYONE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT A BLANK TCASII BOX. LOTS OF LESSONS HERE: 1) ATC; 2) FLY AT APPROPRIATE ALTS; 3) DON'T ASSUME ACFT ARE FOLLOWING FARS; AND 4) ALWAYS LOOK OUT THE WINDOW.,b737 flc take evas action after observ anoth acft come toward them dure clbout which been given BY atc AS A primari target unknown alt readout OR contact apch ctl IN class C airspac .

446,1500,9,I HAD DEPARTED A SMALL UNCTLED FIELD (5B6) ABOUT 15 MI NE OF OUR DEST; MARTHA'S VINEYARD (MVY). WE WERE OPERATING VFR IN MARGINAL VMC CONDITIONS OF 25000 FT BROKEN AND 3 MI VISIBILITY. FLT TIME TO THE VINEYARD WAS INSUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN VFR ADVISORIES; SO AN IFR CLRNC OBTAINED ON THE GND WAS THE ONLY OPTION FOR RADAR SVC. WE ELECTED TO PROCEED VFR. SHORTLY AFTER DEP AT 1500 FT; I OBSERVED A CESSNA 402C 45 DEGS OFF MY R NOSE AT MY ALT; AND FELT WE WERE ON A COLLISION COURSE. I ENTERED A 45 DEG BANK DSNDING TURN TO THE R; AVOIDING THE OTHER ACFT BY ABOUT 500 FT HORIZLY. THE OTHER ACFT DID NOT APPEAR TO DEVIATE. I BELIEVE THE OTHER PLT DID NOT SEE MY ACFT UNTIL WE WERE PASSING ABEAM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. THE C402 APPEARED TO BE ON A VECTOR FOR A DOWNWIND LEG TO THE ILS RWY 24 AT THE VINEYARD. WE WERE ABOUT TO CONTACT THE VINEYARD TWR PRIOR TO ENTERING THE CLASS D AIRSPACE WHEN THE CONFLICT APPEARED.

DEP CTLR CLRED US WITH 'MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION ON THAT ACFT; CLB TO 10000 FT. TFC HAS YOU IN SIGHT.' WE WERE AT 8000 FT MSL. I ESTIMATED THAT TFC WAS INITIALLY ABOUT 5 NM. I MISTAKENLY THOUGHT WE WERE ABOUT PARALLEL. I BEGAN A CLB AT ABOUT 1000 FPM; ON AUTOPLT. I THEN SAW THAT I WAS ON INTERCEPT COURSE WITH TFC. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN GREATER VERT SEPARATION; I INCREASED CLB RATE TO 2500 FPM. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I FELT THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE ADEQUATE VERT AND HORIZ SEPARATION. I DISCONNECTED AUTOPLT AND BEGAN STEEP CLB TO GET VERT SEPARATION. WE GOT RA ON TCASII ABOUT THIS TIME TELLING US TO DSND. WE WERE ABOUT 8600 MSL AND TFC WAS AT 9000 FT MSL. I CONTINUED TO CLB SINCE I WAS ALREADY IN A STEEP CLB AND I COULD OBTAIN VERT SEPARATION FASTER IN A CLB THAN IF I PUSHED THE ACFT OVER TO DSND.

449,3000,5,THIS INCIDENT WAS THE WORST CASE OF HUMAN FACTORS AND NEGATIVE SYNERGY THAT I HAVE SEEN IN MY CAREER. THE ACCIDENT CHAIN WAS 1 LINK AWAY FROM BEING COMPLETE ON THIS FLT. OUR FLT REQUESTED A STRAIGHT-IN RWY 11 VISUAL AND HAD BEEN CLRED TO RWY 11 AND TO EXPEDITE DSCNT TO 3000 FT. RWY 29 WAS THE ACTIVE; BUT TWR OFTEN APPROVES OPPOSITE DIRECTION OPS. BOTH THE VISUAL RWY 29 AND RWY 11 WERE BRIEFED FOR THE APCH. THE STRAIGHT-IN WAS REQUESTED FOR 2 REASONS: FIRST; TO MAKE THINGS EASIER ON THE PF/SIC WHO WAS BEHIND THE AIRPLANE. SECOND; TO EXPEDITE OUR ARR. THE PROB CAME INTO PLAY ON A 5 MI FINAL. WE WERE BEHIND THE PROFILE FOR CONFIGURING WHEN THE PF MADE A TURN OFF FINAL TO A 030 DEG HDG; WHICH WAS TOWARDS THE PREVIOUS DEP. AT THIS TIME I ASKED WHAT HE WAS DOING AND APCH ASKED OUR ALT. NOBODY KNEW WHAT THE OTHER PARTIES IN THIS SIT WERE DOING. THE PF THOUGHT THAT THE 030 DEG VECTOR GIVEN TO OUR COMPANY ACFT WAS FOR US. I THOUGHT WE WERE CLRED FOR THE APCH (AS DID THE PIC OF OUR COMPANY AND FOLLOWING US). APCH THOUGHT WE WERE STOPPING AT 3000 FT. WE FINALLY HAD TO BREAK OFF THE APCH AND CIRCLE TO RWY 29. DURING THE CONFUSION; THE THRUST REVERSERS ARMING WAS SKIPPED ON THE CHKLIST AND THE PF ACCIDENTALLY TURNED OFF THE GND SPOILERS. BOTH OF THESE ITEMS BECAME OBVIOUS DURING THE LNDG ROLL. THIS COMBINED WITH THE PF NOT EXTENDING THE FLT SPOILERS (PER COMPANY OPS) AT TOUCHDOWN (I HAD TO REACH AROUND THE THROTTLE QUADRANT TO DEPLOY THE SPOILERS) MADE FOR A VERY LONG GND ROLL AND HVY BRAKING. (THRUST REVERSERS ARMED DURING THE GND ROLL AND DEPLOYED.) FACTORS: 1) PF/SIC: BEHIND ACFT THOUGH VERY EXPERIENCED IN TYPE. 2) PNF/PIC: APCH AND LNDG EXPECTANCY. 3) CTLR: CTLR CHANGE DURING OUR ARR. NONSTANDARD RADIO PHRASEOLOGY (BOTH MYSELF AND COMPANY (ACFT Y) CAPT UNDERSTOOD 'CLRED' FOR RWY 11 'VISUAL.' WHAT CTLR MEANT WAS 'PROCEED TO RWY 11 AND EXPEDITE TO 3000 FT.' 4) CHKLIST: FIRST 3 ITEMS OF BEFORE LNDG CHKLIST (#1 HYD 'B' PUMPS ON; #2 THRUST REVERSERS ARM; #3 ANNUNCIATOR RECALL) SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE APCH CHKLIST.

MY PAX AND I HEARD THE CITATION CALL HIS POS AS OF 10 MI NE OF THE ARPT; BUT WE DID NOT HEAR THE WORD 'CITATION.' THE CITATION DID NOT ANNOUNCE ITS POS AGAIN UNTIL THE OM; WHICH IS 5 MI FROM THE END OF THE RWY. THE CITATION DID NOT GIVE ITS DISTANCE FROM THE RWY; JUST 'CITATION INBOUND FOR RWY 22.' SINCE A CITATION JET APCHS AT VERY HIGH SPD; IT COVERS A LOT OF DISTANCE BTWN RPTING POINTS IN VERY LITTLE TIME. SINCE I HAD JUST TURNED L BASE; I KNEW THAT A COLLISION WAS IMMINENT. THIS IS BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE THE OM IS LOCATED. NOT ALL VFR PLTS WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHERE THE OM IS LOCATED. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED R AND ANNOUNCED TO ALL TFC THAT I WAS EXTENDING THE DOWNWIND LEG.

451,1500,2,I WAS APCHING THE ASH ARPT FROM THE N; RECEIVING ADVISORIES AND CLASS C SVC FROM MHT. I WAS KEPT HIGHER THAN USUAL (4500 FT VERSUS 2500 FT TYPICALLY) PROBABLY DUE TO THE USE OF A NEW ILS APCH TO MHT RWY 6. MHT APCH INSTRUCTED ME TO DSND (FROM 4500 FT TO THE 1200 FT ASH PATTERN ALT) APPROX 7 MI N OF ASH AND CONTACT ASH TWR. I STARTED A DSCNT AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT NASHUA TWR ON 133.2 MHZ BUT WAS UNABLE DUE TO FREQ CONGESTION. I CIRCLED FOR DSCNT OUTSIDE OF NASHUA'S CLASS D AIRSPACE 5 MI TO THE N. I STARTED INBOUND TO THE FIELD AFTER ESTABLISHING COMS WITH ASH TWR AND NOTIFYING THEM OF MY POS 5 MI TO THE N ON A '45 DEG ENTRY TO R DOWNWIND RWY 32.' THE TWR LATER ASKED MY DISTANCE FROM THE FIELD; TO WHICH I RESPONDED '2.5 MI N.' THEY ASSIGNED ME TO 'ENTER L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 32 AND RPT MIDFIELD.' I ACCEPTED THIS CLRNC BUT QUICKLY REALIZED THIS WOULD CAUSE ME TO CROSS THE DEP END OF RWY 32; ABOUT 1 MI OFF THE DEP END; WHERE I COULD SEE ONE ACFT APCHING THE 1200 FT PATTERN ALT AND HAD KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER ACFT DEPARTING. I ATTEMPTED TO RAISE THE TWR TO REQUEST A R DOWNWIND BUT WAS UNABLE DUE TO FREQ CONGESTION. I CONTINUED TOWARD THE ARPT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE THE TWR. I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE TWR UPON REACHING 'MIDFIELD OF THE R DOWNWIND.' MY APPEARING ON THE R DOWNWIND UPSET THE TWR'S SEQUENCING PLAN OF A TWIN ON THE R DOWNWIND AND SINGLE ENG ACFT ON THE L DOWNWIND. THIS FORCED A TWIN TO FLY A WIDE PATTERN AS IT CAUGHT UP TO ME. I CHOSE TO CONTINUE TO THE R DOWNWIND WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE TWR AFTER ASSESSING THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: 1) CROSS THE EXTENDED CTRLINE TO GET TO THE L DOWNWIND THUS CREATING A CONFLICT WITH DEPARTING ACFT AT THE SAME ALT THAT I WOULD BE XING. 2) CIRCLE 2 MI N OF THE ARPT AT PATTERN ALT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE (WHILE THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST OPTION FROM A REG POINT OF VIEW; I ASSESSED THIS AS NOT VERY SAFE KNOWING THERE WERE ARRIVING ACFT BEHIND ME). 3) CLBING CIRCLE TO THE N TO DEPART THE AREA. CLBING IN THIS AREA WOULD PUT ME BACK INTO THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OF MHT BEFORE BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH COM WITH MHT APCH. 4) CONTINUING TOWARD THE R SIDE OF THE RWY; WHERE THERE WAS NO OTHER TFC IN FRONT OF ME WHILE SORTING THINGS OUT WITH THE TWR. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: HIGHER THAN NORMAL APCH SPD DUE TO STEEP DSCNT ANGLE FROM APCH CTL. BEING ASSIGNED AN UNEXPECTED L DOWNWIND ENTRY THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO CROSS THE EXTENDED CTRLINE WITH TFC DEPARTING ALONG CTRLINE AT SAME ALT.

452,1500,1,I WAS THE WING MAN IN A FLT OF 2 APCHING BDR FOR AN OVERHEAD APCH TO A LNDG. LEAD WAS THE PIPER AZTEC; I WAS WING MAN IN A BEACH BARON. WE WERE IN A L ECHELON FORMATION AT 1000 FT MSL. TWR HAD A MOONEY APCHING FOR A LNDG ON RWY 24 FROM THE R BASE. WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO CLB TO 1500 FT FOR THE OVERHEAD. I HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH LEAD ON THE OTHER COM RADIO AND THE CLB COMMAND WAS GIVEN. I TOOK MY EYE OFF OF LEAD FOR A SECOND TO LOOK AT MY ALTIMETER AND WHEN I LOOKED BACK AT LEAD; HE WAS GONE FROM SIGHT. AT THAT POINT; I HEARD THE MOONEY; WHICH WAS NOW ON FINAL; CALLED OUT ON THE FREQ; 'HEY; THE BARON JUST FLEW UNDER US!' I (IN THE BARON) STATED ON THE FREQ THAT I WAS OVER THE NUMBERS AT 1500 FT AND IT MUST BE THE AZTEC THAT PASSED UNDER THE MOONEY.' AGAIN; I TRIED TO CONTACT MY LEAD (THE AZTEC) AS DID THE TWR; BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND. I THEN ACQUIRED HIM VISUALLY DEPARTING THE PATTERN NWBOUND. I COMPLETED MY OVERHEAD BREAK AND LANDED. A FEW MINS LATER THE AZTEC CONTACTED THE TWR AFTER A SUPPOSED LOSS OF COM AND LANDED. WHEN WE DEBRIEFED ON THE GND AFTER THE FLT; THE LEAD PLT STATED THAT HE KNEW WE WERE DOING THE OVERHEAD BREAK ENTRY; BUT FOR SOME REASON; HE MISTOOK THAT FOR MEANING WE WOULD DO A LOW APCH BEFORE THE BREAK. ALSO; SINCE HE KEPT DSNDING; HE HAD TO MANEUVER TO AVOID THE MOONEY; WHICH HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO IF HE STAYED AT 1000 FT OR 1500 FT AS INSTRUCTED BY ATC. HE ALSO STATED THAT AT THE MOMENT; DSNDING UNDER THE MOONEY APPEARED TO HIM AS THE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO TAKE AT THAT POINT; AND SOMEHOW DURING HIS MANEUVERING HE ACCIDENTALLY TURNED DOWN THE RADIO VOLUME. I CONTACTED THE TWR MGR AS WELL AS ONE OF THE PLTS IN THE MOONEY; AND THE OPERATOR OF THE MOONEY TO DISCUSS WHAT HAPPENED AND THE SIT WAS RESOLVED WITH THEM. A FACTOR THAT WOULD OR COULD HAVE ALLEVIATED THIS SIT WAS POSSIBLY A MORE THOROUGH BRIEFING BTWN MYSELF AND THE LEAD PLT TO MAKE SURE WE BOTH UNDERSTOOD THE PATTERN ENTRY PROC FOR THE OVERHEAD APCH.,nmac btwn A mooney ON final A piper aztec pass 200 FT underneath mooney A low pass .

THE AIRSPACE WAS THE YANKEE MOA FROM 10000 FT TO FL180 AND THE OVERLYING LASER N; E AND W ATCAA'S; FL180 TO FL310 (SEE DIAGRAM). DURING A DEFENSIVE REACTION (NOTCH) 2 F16'S; ACFT X AND ACFT Y DSNDED TO 18000 FT WHILE TIMING OUT RADAR MISSILES ON 1 F15. THEY VISUALLY ACQUIRED A PLANE 6 NM SW OF THEM (AND LOCKED IT WITH ACFT Y RADAR) THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE A LIVE F15. THEY PROCEEDED TO CLOSE FOR A VISUAL IDENT (VID). THEY CLOSED TO 2.1 NM ON THE ACFT'S BEAM AT CO-ALT ACFT Y AT 16000 FT AND ACFT X AT 15000 FT AND IDENTED A COMMUTER AIRLINER.

SINCE IT WAS SEVERE CLR; WE DECIDED TO TAKE OFF VFR AND PICK UP THE IFR ASAP IN THE AIR. AS SOON AS WE DEPARTED RWY 25; K WE CALLED APCH AND GOT A SQUAWK (XPONDER) CODE. HE THEN TOLD US THAT WE HAD TFC AT THE R SIDE 'ALT UNKNOWN.' APCH TOLD US TO TURN TO HDG OF 180 DEGS. WE DID NOT SEE THE OTHER ACFT YET. ATC TOLD US TO TURN FURTHER L TO 150 DEGS. AT THIS TIME WE SPOTTED THE TFC AND SAW THAT WE WERE PASSING HIS ALT AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONFLICT. APPARENTLY; THE ACFT (A BARON) WAS VFR AND WAS NOT TALKING TO ANYONE. THERE WAS NO CONFLICT OR PROB. THE BARON CALLED OUR ACFT AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. I DO NOT KNOW ANY SOLUTION OTHER THAN TO USE 'SEE AND AVOID CONCEPT' AND TO BE VERY VIGILANT IN PROX OF UNCTLED ARPTS. SAFETY IS ALWAYS FIRST IN EVERYTHING; ESPECIALLY AVIATION. I LEARNED THAT ALWAYS BE VERY ALERT IN ANY AIRSPACE -- ESPECIALLY UNCTLED. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 548393: I WAS FLYING IN LEVEL CRUISE FLT WATCHING FOR TFC AND MONITORING PVD APCH CTL.

463,1500,1.5,WHILE ON A LCL TRAINING FLT; I INSTRUCTED MY STUDENT TO LAND AT DANBURY. WE WERE PRESENTLY CLBING OUT OF THE WESTCHESTER ARPT TFC PATTERN. DANBURY'S VICTOR WAS RPTING A LIGHT W WIND; 10 SM VISIBILITY; AND RWY 26 AS THE ACTIVE. WE (THE STUDENT) MADE HIS INITIAL CONTACT 7-10 SM SW AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO ENTER THE L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 26. AT THIS TIME; 2 ACFT WERE ON FINAL (A LUSCOMBE AND ANOTHER ACFT) AND AN ARCHER ON A R BASE. WE MADE OUR INITIAL CONTACT TO TWR AT APPROX XA00 SEP/MON/02. WHILE WE WERE FLYING TOWARDS DANBURY A TWIN CESSNA RPTED W OF THE FIELD FOR LNDG AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO ENTER A L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 26. TWR DID NOT ADVISE OUR PLANE OR THE TWIN CESSNA OF EACH OTHER. WE CONTINUED INBOUND AND TURNED OUR DOWNWIND. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE TWIN CESSNA ANNOUNCED HIS ENTRY INTO THE DOWNWIND. WE CONTINUED INBOUND AND TURNED OUR BASE. MIDWAY THROUGH OUR BASE; TWR INSTRUCTED US TO TURN BACK ONTO THE DOWNWIND. AS WE MADE A R TURN TO REJOIN THE DOWNWIND; THE TWIN CESSNA WAS ON HIS BASE LEG SEVERAL HUNDRED FT ABOVE US AND TO OUR 10-11 O'CLOCK POS. DURING THIS TIME THE TWR WAS MAKING SEVERAL RADIO CALLS; MISTAKING CALL SIGNS BTWN ACFT; AND MISTAKING ACFT POS. WE CONTINUED ON A SBOUND HDG UNTIL ALL OTHER ACFT AND ACFT POS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR. WE WERE THEN INSTRUCTED TO TURN OUR BASE. THE TIME OF OUR CLOSE CALL WAS XB15. I BELIEVE IF THE TWR HAD INSTRUCTED US TO CONTINUE OUR DOWNWIND TO LET THE TWIN CESSNA TURN HIS BASE AHEAD OF US OR HAVE US CONTINUE OUR BASE AND RE-ENTER THE PATTERN ON THE UPWIND TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FASTER TFC; THE POTENTIAL FOR A CLOSE CALL WOULD HAVE BEEN AVERTED. WE (MYSELF AND THE STUDENT) COULD HAVE ALSO REFUSED THE TWR'S INSTRUCTION TO TURN BACK ONTO THE DOWNWIND KNOWING THAT FASTER TFC WAS FOLLOWING US.,instructor student IN c152 turn downwind leg about same time A c401 also turn downwind AT A higher alt .

TFC CAME IN SIGHT WITH ME ABOUT 4000 FT; WHICH I WAS TOLD TO DSND TO AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. THE OTHER PLANE; A TWIN ENG PROP; WAS DSNDING AND MAKING A L TURN TOWARDS US.

MY WIFE IN THE R FRONT SEAT COULD SEE THE PLT'S FACES. IT APPEARED THAT NO INSTRUCTIONS TO STOP THE DSCNT OR TURN WERE GIVEN TO THE OTHER ACFT; WHO MAY HAVE BEEN PREPARING TO LAND AT BOS. THE VECTOR GIVEN TO ME FOR A REVISED HDG SEEMED TO TAKE ME CLOSER TO THE PATH OF THE FASTER DSNDING ACFT.

466,14000,2.5,WHILE ON A R DOWNWIND VISUAL APCH TO RWY 29 AT 1100 FT AGL; I HAD A DSND RA. THE TRIGGER ACFT WAS NEVER IN SIGHT; BUT WAS MOST LIKELY A MIL T2. THE TFC PATTERN WAS FULL AND MY FLT WAS #3 TO FOLLOW A PA28 ON FINAL. THE TRIGGER ACFT WAS SEEN TO FLY THROUGH THE FINAL FROM L BASE TO THE R DOWNWIND ON TCASII. OBSERVING THE TARGET CLOSURE; I ACCELERATED (FROM THE TWR REQUESTED MINIMUM APCH SPD) IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID CONFLICT. THE TARGET MATCHED MY SPD AND ALT CHANGES EXACTLY THROUGH THE TA. THE DSND RA OCCURRED AT 1100 FT AGL (NOT INCLUDING THE TALL ANTENNA FARM). AT 200 FT SEPARATION 900 FT AGL; THE 'DSND' RA CHANGED TO A LEVEL 'MONITOR VERT SPD' RA. THE EGPWS NEVER TRIGGERED. ON BASE THE TRIGGER ACFT TRIGGERED ANOTHER TA. THE T2 WAS OBSERVED CLRING RWY 29 SHORTLY AFTER MY ACFT. AT NO TIME DID TWR ISSUE AN ADVISORY; WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO DISTRS BY OTHER SMALL ACFT IN THE FULL PATTERN. THE THOUGHT THAT A MIL TRAINING FLT WOULD PERFORM AN UNANNOUNCED UNAUTH INTERCEPT AND FORMATION FLT IN A TFC PATTERN IS UNACCEPTABLE! YET THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THAT CONCLUSION. THE T2 WAS THE ONLY ACFT IN THE PATTERN THAT COULD MATCH THE LJ60 PERFORMANCE. A VISUAL CONFIRMATION COULD NOT BE MADE DUE TO THE TARGET BEING IN THE 5 O'CLOCK POS BLIND SPOT. IF FOR SOME REASON IT WAS A FALSE RA (UNLIKELY!); THEN A DSCNT RA AT 1100 FT AGL WAS HIGHLY DANGEROUS. LUCKILY ENOUGH; THE WX WAS CAVU.

467,14000,30,AFTER DEPARTING BOS; WE WERE ON ZBW FREQ AT 14000 FT. TFC WAS CALLED AT 15000 FT AT 10 O'CLOCK POS. THE TFC AT 15000 FT RPTED US IN SIGHT AND WAS CLRED TO REMAIN IN VISUAL CONTACT. WE THEN ACQUIRED AND RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLRED TO FL230 AND TO REMAIN VISUAL. I INITIATED THE CLB ON AUTOPLT VERT SPD AT ABOUT 1500 FPM. THE FO AND I WATCHED THE TFC AND BOTH COMMENTED ON HOW CLOSE IT LOOKED. AFTER A FEW SECONDS; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT IN ANTICIPATION OF LOWERING THE NOSE. ABOUT THEN; THE TCASII ISSUED AN RA AND I LOWERED THE NOSE MORE. THE OTHER ACFT WENT OVER US L TO R AND A CLR OF CONFLICT WAS HEARD. SOON; THE CTLR ASKED IF WE HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE TFC IN VISUAL CONTACT. THE FO RPTED NO. WE SAW THE TFC COMING AND I STARTED TO REACT BEFORE THE TCASII; BUT IT STILL WAS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. IN OVER 30 YRS OF FLYING LARGE ACFT; THIS IS A FIRST. I DON'T THINK IT IS SAFE TO ALLOW VISUAL SEPARATION FOR JET ACFT. IT IS TOO HARD TO JUDGE THE SEPARATION AND CLOSURE RATES. I WILL NOT ACCEPT ONE AGAIN AND THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION ON BOTH AIRPLANES THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WILL DO; BUT YOU DON'T. BOTH THE COPLT AND I AGREE WE WILL JUST TAKE THE RADAR SEPARATION NEXT TIME WITH NO ASSUMPTIONS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 565898: HE CLRED US TO CLB TO FL230. I TOLD CTR WE HAD TFC AND WERE CLBING TO FL230. CTR TOLD US TO MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION AS WELL. THE CAPT STARTED THE CLB IN VERT SPD. AT THIS TIME; THE RJ WAS ABOUT 5 MI AND HDG NW. WE WERE HDG W. AS WE STARTED TO CLB; I LOOKED AT THE RJ AND IT APPEARED TO BE TURNING TOWARD US. I WAS GETTING READY TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE CAPT WHEN WE GOT A TCASII TA. THE CAPT DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND I LOOKED AT THE RJ AGAIN AND HE WAS STILL TURNING INTO US. THE CAPT WAS LOWERING THE NOSE AS THE RJ FLEW BEHIND US. I GUESSED THE DISTANCE TO BE AROUND 800 FT. AS THE RJ WAS PASSING BEHIND; WE GOT A MOMENTARY 'DSND' RA. A FEW MOMENTS LATER; CTR CALLED AND ASKED IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE MAINTAINING A VISUAL WITH THE RJ AND I SAID NO. I FEEL IT WAS HARD TO JUDGE CLOSURE IN OUR CLB AND NEXT TIME I WOULD NOT CALL VISUAL ON THE TFC. I THINK THE RJ WAS TURNING TO PASS BEHIND US; BUT DID NOT REALIZE HE WAS CLOSING THE DISTANCE BTWN US.

468,34000,15,THE E145 WAS CLBING TO FL330 REQUESTING A FINAL ALT OF FL370; EBOUND TOWARD CYHZ. THE B747 WAS SWBOUND LEVEL AT FL350. TFC WAS CALLED TO BOTH ACFT AND BOTH PLTS RESPONDED WITH NO CONTACT. AS THE CONVERGING ACFT APCHED EACH OTHER; I ASKED THE PLT OF THE E145 IF HE WAS 'RVSM CAPABLE.' HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED 'AFFIRMATIVE.' I THEN ASKED THE PLT WHAT HIS EQUIP QUALIFIER WAS. HE SAID HE WASN'T SURE. I TOLD HIM THAT RVSM QUALIFIERS ARE /Q OR /W. HE SAID 'WE HAVE FMS ONBOARD SO WHATEVER YOU NEED IT TO BE IS FINE.' I TOLD HIM I WOULD SHOW HIS EQUIP AS /Q AND ISSUED THE E145 A CLB TO FL340 AND AGAIN ISSUED HIS TFC. THE PLT RPTED THE B747 IN SIGHT AND ACKNOWLEDGED CLBING TO FL340. WHEN SEEN LEAVING FL332; THE E145 PLT ASKED; 'CTR; WHAT WAS THE QUESTION YOU ASKED US BEFORE OUR QUALIFIER TYPE?' I SAID; 'ARE YOU RVSM QUALIFIED?' HE REPLIED; 'EXACTLY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?' TECHNICALLY; SEPARATION WAS LOST AT THIS POINT WITH LESS THAN 4 MI AND LESS THAN 2000 FT NOT BEING SURE THAT THIS PROC WAS LEGAL FOR THE E145. I EXPLAINED TO THE PLT WHAT RVSM WAS; AND HE WAS VERY UNSURE SOUNDING. HE SAID; 'IF IT IS NOT A PROB FOR YOU; IT'S NOT A PROB FOR US.' (STANDARD PLTDEV RESPONSE.) DUE TO THE SPD AND NO CHANCE THAT THE ACFT WOULD ACTUALLY HIT (THE E145 WAS BEHIND THE B747) NO ACTION WAS TAKEN SEPARATION WISE. BECAUSE THE PLT'S INITIAL 'AFFIRMATIVE' ANSWER TO HIS CAPABILITIES WAS RECEIVED; I FOLLOWED ALL CORRECT PROCS AND ISSUED A CLRNC TO PROVIDE A SVC. IT IS OBVIOUS THIS PROB AROSE BECAUSE A PLT CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED A QUESTION HE WAS NOT SURE OF.

469,3000,6,I CONTACTED BDL APCH; ON 119.0; 7 MI W ORH; REQUESTED PRACTICE NDB 29 INTO ORH. WAS TOLD 'NO SEPARATION PROVIDED; CONTACT ORH TWR.' ORH APPROVED PRACTICE APCH; WITH ADVICE 'NO SEPARATION SVCS WILL BE PROVIDED.' I WAS ALSO ADVISED TO RPT GOZER OUTBOUND. I WAS FLYING VFR; NO HOOD; TO GENERALLY PRACTICE ADF ORIENTATION. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I FLY THE APCH VFR; NOT AS AN INST APCH; BUT TO GET A FEEL FOR MY VISUAL POSITIONING AT VARIOUS POINTS ON THE APCH. I WAS LOOKING FOR TFC; GETTING A FEEL FOR THE GENERAL ORIENTATION OF THE APCH. AS I APCHED GOZER; I SPOTTED THE BONANZA JUST AFTER IT FLASHED ACROSS IN FRONT OF ME; AND PROCEEDED OUTBOUND ON THE PROC TURN. A FEW MOMENTS LATER; I REACHED GOZER AND ALSO BEGAN THE PROC TURN. ORH TWR CONTACTED ME AT THAT POINT AND SAID THAT DBL WAS WORKING ANOTHER ACFT ON THE PRACTICE APCH AT GOZER; AND I MIGHT WANT TO FLY THE APCH AT 3500 FT.

470,24000,10,I WAS THE RADAR CTLR AT THE BOSOX SECTOR. DURING MY TIME AT THIS POS; I WAS INVOLVED IN A SIT CONCERNING ACR X AND ACR Y. ACR X WAS A BOS DEP; FLT PLANNED VIA CTR. I HANDLED ACR X NORMALLY INCLUDING USING AN AUTOMATED INFO HDOF/XFER PROC WITH SECTOR 46. DURING THIS TIME; I RECEIVED A POINTOUT FROM SECTOR 36; THE GARDNER SECTOR; ON ACR Y; A MHT DEP ENRTE TO IAD. I APPROVED THE POINTOUT ON ACR Y FROM SECTOR 36 STATING IN MY APPROVAL; FL230. SHORTLY AFTER APPROVING THE POINTOUT ON ACR Y; I SAW THE INTERIM ALT OF FL230 HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE DATA BLOCK OF ACR Y; AND THAT THE ASSIGNED ALT OF FL280 WAS NOW DISPLAYED. I CALLED SECTOR 36 AND ASKED THEM TO ASSIGN FL230 TO ACR Y. IT WAS AGREED THAT ACR Y WOULD BE ISSUED FL230; AND THAT I WOULD WORK ACR Y. ACR Y CHKED ON MY FREQ; A SPD RESTR FOR SPACING TO IAD WAS ISSUED DUE TO TFC VIRTUALLY OVERHEAD ACR Y; ALSO ENRTE TO IAD. AS ACR Y APCHED ACR X; I ISSUED TFC. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; I OBSERVED ACR Y BEHIND ACR X AND AT FL233 OR THEREABOUTS; AND ASKED THE PLT TO VERIFY ALT. THE PLT STATED FL280.

DURING THE BACK TAXI; TWR SPOKE TO ANOTHER ACFT; BUT I DIDN'T REALLY PAY TOO MUCH ATTN TO IT; BECAUSE IT WAS NOT FOR OUR ACFT; AND I WAS CONFIRMING TKOF CHKLIST ITEMS. DURING CLBOUT AT ABOUT 1000 FT MSL/AGL; JUST BEFORE I WAS GOING TO BEGIN MY ON COURSE TURN NBOUND; THE TCASII SYS WENT OFF YELLING 'TFC; TFC.'

HE SAID 'YES; A GRUMMAN; BUT HE SHOULD NOT BE A FACTOR.' I SAID 'WELL; HE WAS A FACTOR; BECAUSE HE JUST BLEW PAST OUR R WING; AND THE TCASII WENT OFF!' THE GRUMMAN RESPONDED THAT 'IT WASN'T REALLY THAT CLOSE;' BUT I FOUND OUT LATER WHY IT DIDN'T SEEM AS CLOSE TO HIM; BECAUSE THE XMISSION I HEARD WHILE ON MY BACK TAXI; BUT DIDN'T LISTEN TO; WAS THE TWR TELLING THE GRUMMAN THAT I WAS DEPARTING RWY 6; TO LOOK OUT FOR ME. IF THE TWR SAID TO ME HE DIDN'T THINK THE GRUMMAN WOULD BE A FACTOR; WHY DID HE ISSUE US AS TFC TO THE GRUMMAN?

472,3500,20.1,BOSTON APCH GAVE US A DSCNT TO 3000 FT MSL AT LOBBY; AND TO EXPECT THE VISUAL APCH TO RWY 23 AT BED. WE WERE HEADING APPROX 75 DEGS DIRECT TO LOBBY. PASSING THROUGH 4500 FT MSL; OUR TCASII GAVE US A TA ON AN ACFT BELOW AND TO OUR R AT 1.5 MI. THE TCASII RESOLUTION DIRECTED US TO DSND AT 1200-1400 FPM TO AVOID THE TFC. I TOOK THIS ACTION AT THE SAME TIME THE CTLR INSTRUCTED US TO CLB TO 4000 FT MSL. SIMULTANEOUSLY; THE PNF ACQUIRED THE TFC VISUALLY; AND TALKED MY EYES ONTO THE TFC. THE TFC WAS XING R TO L ON A NORTHERLY HDG. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED TO THE R (S) SO AS TO LAG THE COLLISION COURSE AND FURTHER INCREASE THE LATERAL SEPARATION ALONG WITH THE TCASII COMMAND FOR VERT SEPARATION. THE VISUAL EVASIVE ACTION ACTUALLY SHALLOWED MY DSCNT TO LEVEL FLT; AND WE PASSED BEHIND THE CESSNA BY APPROX 550-1000 FT LATERALLY; AND SLIGHTLY HIGH ON THE FLT PATH. IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE; THAT AS MY FLT PATH SHALLOWED OUT BY MY VISUAL MANEUVERING; THE TCASII COMMANDED AN IMMEDIATE CLB. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TCASII TO THIS FLUID MANEUVERING/ENVIRONMENT. NO PRIOR WARNING OF TFC WAS GIVEN TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT BY APCH CTL. IF THIS HAD BEEN A TRUE IMC OR NON-VISUAL EVENT; I BELIEVED THE TCASII WAS CORRECT FROM MY SIGHT PICTURE; AND THE COMMANDED DSCNT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US RIGHT UNDER THE CESSNA WITHOUT INCURRING A COLLISION. THE XING ANGLE WAS A TRUE COLLISION COURSE; AND WOULD HAVE PLACED US DIRECTLY UNDER THE CESSNA'S FLT PATH. FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN FLYING FIGHTERS IN THE USAF; THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEFINITE VIOLATION OF THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT 500 FT BUBBLE. WITH THE PROX OF THE ATC HDOF TO BEDFORD TWR; I WAS NOT ABLE TO TALK WITH THE CTLR AND TO INFORM HIM THAT WE MANEUVERED OFF TCASII. I THINK FROM HIS REPLIES ON THE RADIO AFTER THE INCIDENT; THAT HE; TOO; KNEW IT WAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER. TCASII TRAINING PAID OFF. FOLLOW THE COMMANDS. THE FIRST THING THAT FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND AS THE TCASII COMMANDED ONE DIRECTION AND THE CTLR DIRECTED ANOTHER; WAS THE MID AIR IN GERMANY LAST YR. MY PNF DID A GREAT JOB ON VISUALLY ACQUIRING THE TFC; AND CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING THE MISS DISTANCE THROUGH GOOD VERBAL DIRECTIONS. HE WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE EVASIVE ACTION VISUALLY IF I HAD NOT DONE SO; AND I HAD NOT VERBALIZED MY ACTIONS TO HIM AT THE GIVEN MOMENT. HIS HANDS WERE 'RESTING' ON THE YOKE. AS WE APCHED BED; ON THE EXTENDED R BASE TO RWY 23. WE FLEW RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF A MOONEY THAT WAS ON THE R DOWNWIND TO RWY 23. THE ATC TWR CTLR WAS OVERLOADED WITH DEPS; ARRS; AND VFR PATTERNS.

SHE SAID THAT'S HOW THEIR SOFTWARE WORKED; BUT I WAS GLAD IT WAS POSTED. AFTER LOOKING INTO THE TWR A LITTLE FURTHER; I FOUND OUT THE LIGHT HAD BEEN OUT FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS.

476,7000,16,I WAS ASSIGNED THE E ARR RADAR POS; WHICH ROUTINELY OPERATES WITH 2 RADAR SECTORS COMBINED. THIS WAS THE CONFIGN AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. I HAD BEEN ON THE POS FOR 11 MINS WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. I WAS WORKING 8 ACFT; WHICH WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE APCH CTL AIRSPACE. ACFT #1 WAS AN IFR RWY 1 DEP FROM BURLINGTON ARPT (BTV); INITIALLY ASSIGNED RWY HEADING BY THE TWR. THE CTLR PRIOR TO MYSELF ISSUED A 100 DEG HDG; FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY A 120 DEG HDG FOR TFC INBOUND TO THE ARPT FROM THE S. THE ACFT WAS ASSIGNED 7000 FT. WHEN THE TFC WAS NO FACTOR; I ISSUED A 160 DEG HDG WITH INSTRUCTION TO PROCEED DIRECT TO THE LEBANON (LEB) VORTAC WHEN ABLE. THIS ACFT WAS GPS-EQUIPPED; SO THE TIME FRAME FOR THE ACFT TO HAVE BEEN FLYING THE 160 DEG HDG SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINIMAL. ACFT #2 WAS AN IFR ARR TO BTV FROM THE S (NOT THE ORIGINAL TFC FOR ACFT #1). ACFT #2 WAS LEVEL AT 7000 FT. ACFT #2 CAME ON FREQ WITH A VERY WEAK RADIO; OF WHICH I ADVISED THE PLT. I ALSO ADVISED ACFT #2 TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 33. SEVERAL MINS AFTER INITIAL CONTACT; ACFT #2 REQUESTED AN ILS/DME APCH TO RWY 33. I ISSUED A 070 DEG HDG TO THE RWY 33 LOC. I THEN TENDED TO OTHER HIGHER PRIORITY DUTIES; INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF MANDATORY TA'S TO VFR ACFT LOCATED WITHIN THE BTV CLASS C AIRSPACE AND ASSOCIATED OUTER AREA. AT THIS TIME; I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT ACFT #1 AND ACFT #2 WOULD BECOME FACTORS FOR EACH OTHER. WHEN I RETURNED MY ATTN TO ACFT #2 FOR THE TURN TO FINAL; I FIRST NOTICED THE ACFT WAS A BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE FIX FROM WHERE THE APCH COMMENCED AND WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE A VECTOR TO WIDEN THE ACFT PATH. I NOTICED THE PROX OF ACFT #1 AND IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A DSCNT INSTRUCTION TO ACFT #2. AT THIS TIME; THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF SEPARATION BTWN THE ACFT; SO THE ACTION TAKEN WAS TO MITIGATE THE SEPARATION LOSS. I WAS FRANKLY SURPRISED BY THE PROX OF THE 2 ACFT. THE REPLAY OF THE RADAR DATA INDICATED THE ACFT WAS TRACKING NEARLY DUE S FOR SEVERAL MI; COMING MUCH CLOSER TO THE RWY 33 LOC THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. IN RETROSPECT; ISSUING A DSCNT TO ACFT #2 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE INITIAL VECTOR TO THE LOC WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRUDENT MOVE AND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE PREVENTED THE LOSS OF SEPARATION. I HAVE BEEN FACED WITH SIMILAR SITS AND IN MOST CASES; WOULD HAVE GIVEN BOTH CTL INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. I AM UNABLE TO PINPOINT WHY I DID NOT DO THAT IN THIS INSTANCE; BUT IT IS POSSIBLE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WEAK RADIO OR A HIGHER PRIORITY DUTY. OTHER POINTS: 1) THERE WERE AT LEAST 4 OTHER CTLR PERSONNEL IN THE TRACON AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; INCLUDING ONE OPS SUPVR. MOST OF THESE PERSONNEL WERE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION AT THE SUPVR'S DESK. THE ARR DATA CTLR; WHO ORDINARILY WOULD BE SEATED ADJACENT TO THE ARR RADAR POS; WAS NOT THERE BUT WAS NEAR THE SUPVR'S DESK. IF AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD BEEN WATCHING A RADAR SCOPE; THEN; MORE THAN LIKELY; THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. 2) THE BUILT-IN CONFLICT ALERT (CA) PROBE OF THE ARTS IIE EQUIP; WHILE PROBABLY FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED; WAS TOTALLY USELESS IN THIS INSTANCE TO PREVENT A LOSS OF SEPARATION. THE CA DIDN'T SOUND UNTIL WELL AFTER I REALIZED THE LOSS OF SEPARATION WAS OCCURRING. WHEN THE CA SOUNDED; THE ACFT TARGETS WERE NEARLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH ALREADY INCREASING SEPARATION. INDEED; THE CTLR'S DEFINITION FOR 'CA' IS 'COMING APART.' A MORE USEFUL TOOL WOULD BE A WARNING WELL PRIOR TO THE LOSS OF SEPARATION OCCURRING. THAT IS; A PROBE THAT EXTENDS 5-10 MI AHEAD OF THE ACFT. WHILE I CAN BLAME NO ONE BUT MYSELF FOR THIS OCCURRENCE; I CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT WITH JUST 1 OR 2 FACTORS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT; THE INCIDENT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED.,btv ctlr experienc loss OF separ btwn arr dep tfc .

BEFORE I COULD TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION THE JET WAS PAST US TRAVELING AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPD.

IF THEY DID; THE TURN MAY HAVE BEEN EVASIVE ACTION AND THEY MUST HAVE SEEN ME AT THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND TO AVOID A COLLISION. I DID NOT CONTACT THE TWR TO INFORM THEM OF THE NEAR MISS AND DON'T KNOW IF THEY EVEN REALIZED THE POTENTIAL DISASTER. I ASSUME WHEN IN CTLED AIRSPACE THE CTLR CTLS?

490,16000,20,THE AUTOPLT WAS ENGAGED IN LNAV AND VERT SPD MODE. WE HAD BEEN CLRED DIRECT TO EEN; THEN MHT; AND WE WERE ALSO INSTRUCTED TO CROSS 25 MI W OF MHT AT 9000 FT. AS DIRECTED IN OUR NEW PROCS; WE WERE NAVING VIA LNAV IN A -300; SO BOTH OF OUR HSI SELECTOR SWITCHES WERE IN NAV. I DO NOT RECALL WHAT WAS SET IN OUR MANUAL VOR WINDOWS. BASED ON MY PREVIOUS HABITS; IM FAIRLY CERTAIN I HAD THE LOC FREQ FOR RWY 17 AT MHT SET IN MINE; SINCE THATS THE APCH I WAS PLANNING. PASSING FL190 ON PROFILE; THE ACFT BEGAN A R-HAND TURN USING 15-20 DEGS OF BANK. AT THE TIME; I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD; BUT I WAS MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON CALLING FOR THE DSCNT CHKLIST. AS THE TURN CONTINUED AND THE BANK INCREASED; I QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THE CHKLIST AND DEVOTED MY FULL ATTN TO WHERE THE ACFT WAS GOING. BASED ON THE WAY WE WERE APCHING EEN; I HAD EXPECTED A SLIGHT R TURN. HOWEVER; THE EXTENT OF THE TURN BEING CONDUCTED DIDNT SEEM RIGHT. I CHKED THE SCOREBOARD AND CONFIRMED LNAV WAS STILL ENGAGED -- IT WAS. I THEN LOOKED AT THE LEGS PAGE -- STILL SHOWED EEN-MHT ALTHOUGH THE HDGS WERE DIFFERENT THAN WHERE WE WERE TURNING. I QUICKLY TRIED TO XCHK RAW DATA; BUT WE DIDNT HAVE EEN IN EITHER WINDOW; SO IT TOOK A MOMENT TO FIND THE FREQ AND DIAL IT IN. AS I WAS DOING ALL THIS; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND BEGAN A L-HAND TURN BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE. (I WOULD ESTIMATE THE ACFT HAD TURNED ABOUT 45 DEGS TO THE R BY THE TIME I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT.) DURING THE L-HAND TURN; I LOOKED BACK DOWN AT THE FMS AND NOTICED IT WAS BLANK WITH FMC FAIL DISPLAYED. ABOUT THIS TIME; ZBW BEGAN INQUIRING ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING. BOSTON GAVE US A CLRNC TO TURN L TO 020 DEGS AND TO MAINTAIN 16000 FT. AT THIS TIME; WE WERE ALREADY BELOW 16000 FT AND THE CAPT ASKED IF THEY WANTED US TO CLB BACK UP. BOSTON SAID AFFIRMATIVE AND SO I CLBED THE ACFT AND LEVELED AT 16000 FT AND ROLLED OUT ON THE 020 DEG HDG. I ASKED THE CAPT TO DO THE DSCNT CHKLIST TO GET OUR ALTIMETERS SET. DURING THIS TIME; BOSTON WAS ALSO GIVING CTL INSTRUCTIONS TO AT LEAST 1 OTHER ACFT WHO I PERCEIVED WE HAD BECOME IN CONFLICT WITH. AFTER A COUPLE MORE HDG AND ALT CHANGES; WE WERE GIVEN DIRECT MHT AGAIN. DURING ALL THE TALKING ON THE RADIO; WE WERE TRYING TO DO THE CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE CHKLIST. AT SOME POINT; ATC CALLED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS SORTED OUT AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO PROB. AS YOU MIGHT GUESS; THIS IS MY BEST RECOLLECTION OF THE EVENTS WHICH TRANSPIRED. IT ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND AT A SIGNIFICANT POINT IN THE FLT WHEN WE WERE DSNDING QUICKLY AND TRANSITIONING THROUGH FL180. LESSONS LEARNED: WELL; FOR ONE THING; I DONT LIKE THE NEW LNAV GUIDANCE. HAD WE BEEN FLYING THIS SAME FLT 2 WKS AGO; I HAVE NO DOUBT THE PLT MONITORING WOULD HAVE HAD THE APPROPRIATE NAVAID TUNED UP AND WHEN THE TURN STARTED; I COULD HAVE KNOWN IMMEDIATELY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND MADE THE APPROPRIATE CORRECTION RIGHT AWAY. I ALSO THINK THE NEW POLICY OF NOT HAVING SILENT CHKLISTS IS FLAWED AS WELL. ITS DARK AND IM TRYING TO HAND FLY THE ACFT TO AVOID A TFC CONFLICT AND IM HAVING TO READ AND RESPOND TO A NEW CHKLIST -- NOT GOOD. OF COURSE; I WAS FLYING AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT. MY CRITICISM OF THE NEW PROCS IS THEY LED ME DOWN THE PRIMROSE PATH TO A STATE OF REDUCED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. MY CRITICISM ALSO APPLIES TO THE NEW CLB CHK. DURING A VERY BUSY PHASE OF FLT; WE HAVE TO DIVERT OUR ATTN FROM FLYING THE ACFT TO PROVIDE AURAL RESPONSES TO ANOTHER GUY READING A CHKLIST. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 615900: THINKING BACK ON IT; I THINK THE NEW PROCS SET US UP FOR THAT CONFLICT. FIRST WE WERE BOTH IN NAV; WHICH I DISAGREE WITH. IN THE -300 I THINK THE PLT MONITORING NEEDS TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE FLT. THATS TOUGH TO DO ON THE DSCNT PAGE WITH BOTH IN NAV. SECONDLY; WE WERE BOTH OUT OF THE LOOP INITIALLY BECAUSE WE WERE CHALLENGING AND RESPONDING TO THE DSCNT CHKLIST. THEREFORE; BOTH PLTS WERE DISTR FROM FLYING RATHER THAN 1 PLT. I THINK THAT CHKLIST AND THE CLBCHKLIST NEED TO BE ADJUSTED; OR CHANGED TO SILENT COMPLETION. WE HAD AN FMC ABNORMALITY THAT NEEDED TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH TO COMPLETION. THAT IS A LOT OF DISTRS DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SOME OF IT WAS SELF-IMPOSED DUE TO THE NEW PROCS.,A b737-300 crew A track dev IN zbw class E airspac . autoplt wa engag IN lnav vert spd mode .

497,15500,20,FLT XXXX (ZZZ-BOS) DSNDED FROM CRUISE ALT TO FL270 WITH ZNY WHILE ENRTE FROM CHAMP INTXN TO PVD VOR. AFTER HDOF TO ZBW; ACR X WAS KEPT AT FL270 UNTIL PASSING OVER AN EBOUND ACR Y FLT. PASSING THE EASTERN TIP OF LONG ISLAND; ACR X REQUESTED LOWER ALT IN ANTICIPATION OF A NORMAL CLRNC TO CROSS PVD AT 11000 FT. THE ZBW CTLR GAVE ACR X A SLIGHT L VECTOR TO AVOID TFC TO THE E; THEN CLRED US TO FL210 AND TO PROCEED DIRECT PVD. HE THEN HANDED ACR X OFF TO ANOTHER ZBW CTLR. THIS CTLR CLRED ACR X DIRECT TO INNDY INTXN (PVD 093 DEG RADIAL/15 DM) AND GAVE A CLRNC TO CROSS INNDY AT 11000 FT. THIS WAS VERY HELPFUL; AS ACR X WAS ALREADY HIGH IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO CROSS PVD AT 11000 FT. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE CTLR SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF: 'BOSTON IS LNDG RWY 4R; WE NEED YOU TO CROSS PVD AT 11000 FT.' AT THIS POINT ACR X WAS ABOUT 20 (?) MI SSE OF PVD HDG NE TOWARD INNDY. AS THE FO (PF) EXTENDED THE SPD BRAKES; WENT TO IDLE PWR AND BEGAN A L TURN; THE CAPT QUERIED THE CTLR OVER THE CLRNC SINCE IT NECESSITATED A STEEP DSCNT TO PVD. THE ZBW CTLR REAFFIRMED THE CLRNC. AT THIS TIME; ACR X WAS ENTERING A L 25-30 DEG BANK FROM A HDG OF ABOUT 040 DEGS TO 340 DEGS AND DSNDING AT ABOUT 3500 FPM. AS ACR X APCHED 17000 FT IN A RAPID DSCNT; THE ZBW CTLR CALLED OUT VFR TFC AHEAD AT 15500 FT. NEAR SIMULTANEOUSLY; A TCASII EMPTY DIAMOND CONTACT FIRST APPEARED ON THE SCOPE AT 11-12 O'CLOCK POS. THIS CONTACT THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED INTO A SOLID DIAMOND; INDICATING LESS THAN 6 MI LATERAL DISTANCE AND WITHIN 1200 FT ALT. BECAUSE OF THE L TURN TOWARD PVD; WAS BELLY UP TO THE TFC; CONVERGING (DUE TO TURN RADIUS); AND APCHING ITS ALT. ROLLING OUT TO GAIN VISUAL CONTACT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE RATE OF LATERAL CLOSURE. THE FLT CREW THEN HAD TO MAKE A SNAP JUDGEMENT WITH ZERO TIME FOR DISCUSSION: DSND THROUGH THE ALT OF THE VFR TFC WHILE ON A CONVERGING COURSE; OR LEVELOFF ABOVE THE VFR TFC. CAPT (PNF) ELECTED THE LATTER COURSE OF ACTION; TOOK THE ACFT AND BEGAN TO AGGRESSIVELY LEVEL OFF. ACR X LEVELED AT 15800 FT (300 FT VERT SEPARATION ON TCASII); THEN CLBED ABOUT 500 FT WHILE CLRING TO THE N OF THE VFR TFC. BASED ON THE TCASII DISPLAY; IT APPEARED THAT THE MINIMUM SEPARATION WAS ABOUT 3 MI. THERE WAS NO TCASII TA OR RA THROUGHOUT THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. ACR X ASKED THE ZBW CTLR WHETHER SHE WAS AWARE OF THE TFC; AND A MALE VOICE ANSWERED STATING THEY HAD ISSUED A TA. PRESUMABLY; THIS WAS THE ONE CALL ACR X RECEIVED WHILE DSNDING INTO THE VFR ACFT APPROX 2 MI ON THE NOSE. ACR X ADVISED ZBW THAT THE FLT WOULD NOT CROSS PVD AT 11000 FT AND ASKED THE CTLR TO MARK THE TIME AND SAVE THE (RADAR) TAPES. THE ZBW CTLR THEN HANDED ACR X OFF TO BOS APCH; WHICH VECTORED US FOR AN ILS RWY 4R. BASED ON OTHER TFC OBSERVED AFTER THE HDOF; IT DID NOT APPEAR TO THE FLT CREW THAT THE VECTORING OVER PVD WAS DRIVEN BY A NEED TO ATTAIN SPACING WITH OTHER ACFT INBOUND TO BOS AHEAD OF US. A NORMAL APCH AND LNDG WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ACCOMPLISHED. ACR X FLT REGULARLY RECEIVES EXCELLENT SVC FROM ZBW. THIS INCIDENT WAS AN ABERRATION; ALBEIT A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ONE.

503,14000,15,THE BOSOX RADAR POS (POS 47 R) WAS BEING OPERATED BY A NEWLY CERTIFIED ENRTE CTLR QUALIFIED AT 2 OF 6 RADAR POS WITHIN THEIR ZBW AREA OF SPECIALTY. THE CTLR IS NEW TO THE AGENCY WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS ATC EXPERIENCE. I WAS AT THE BOSOX SECTOR POS 47 RA; THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS. THE RADAR CTLR APPEARED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO TFC; HOWEVER; THEIR OPERATIONAL APPLICATION HAD INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MODIFIED AND RESCINDED CLRNCS NECESSARY TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION BTWN TFC WITHIN THEIR AREA OF JURISDICTION; THESE MODIFIED CLRNCS INDICATED A LACK OF TFC AWARENESS AND PREPLANNING. THE 2 ACFT PROMPTING THIS RPT WERE BOSTON DEPS BEING HANDLED NORMALLY BY BOSTON DEP CTL (NOW BCT; BOSTON CONSOLIDATED TRACON). AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT MY ATTN AS AN ASSOCIATE CTLR HAD BEEN ON AN A320 ENRTE TO JFK VIA AN AMENDED ROUTING THAT PLACED THE ACFT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC SITS WITH VARIOUS SECTOR TFC FLOWS; AS WELL AS; REQUIRING OBSERVATION AND COORD WITH THE SECTOR ABOVE BOSOX FOR SEQUENCING WITH OTHER JFK TFC. PLANNING THE A320 SEQUENCING REQUIRED THAT I MOMENTARILY STAND AND OBSERVE POS R46 (BOSTON); A SECTOR TO OUR R; AND PHYSICALLY LOOK AT THEIR TFC; SINCE ASKING THE 47 RADAR CTLR TO QUICK LOOK POS 46 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DISTRACTING AT THAT MOMENT; AND SECTOR 46 WAS TOO BUSY TO DISCUSS OR VIEW THE A320'S PRESENT POS AND PROJECTED COURSE. SECTOR 47 RECEIVED A VOICE CALL FROM BOSTON DEP ASKING 'ARE YOU ALRIGHT WITH THOSE TWO?' (OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT); MY ATTN WAS THEN REDIRECTED TO THE TFC W OF BOSTON AT POS R47. THE 2 ACFT PROMPTING THIS RPT; AN ACR Y AND ACR Z WERE W OF BOSTON IN RELATIVE CLOSE VERT PROX WITH APPROX 5 NM SEPARATION WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN OVERTAKING SIT FROM BEHIND (THE SECTION IN WHICH THE 2 ACFT WERE LOCATED IS SINGLE-SITE ADAPTED; THEREFORE; 3 NM SEPARATION IS THE MINIMUM WHEN ACFT ARE WAKE-TURB COMPATIBLE). I DIRECTED THE RADAR CTLR'S ATTN TO THE SIT; THE RADAR CTLR THEN ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE VAGUE; CONFUSING AND INEFFECTIVE; THE PLT OF ACR Z ACFT QUESTIONED THE CLRNC AND APPEARED TO QUESTION THE PROX OF THE TFC ADVISED BY THE RADAR CTLR TO WHICH IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR ME TO INTERVENE AND INSTRUCT THE RADAR CTLR TO TELL ACR Y TO 'STOP CLB.' THE OEDP APPARENTLY DETECTED LESS THAN 5 NM BTWN THE SUBJECT ACFT; THOUGH MY OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT AT NO TIME DID SEPARATION DIMINISH TO LESS THAN 3 NM. REGRETTABLY; THE OBSERVED PERFORMANCE OF RECENTLY CERTIFIED PERSONNEL IS ALL TOO SIMILAR TO THIS EVENT. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THIS NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR HAS REQUIRED THE OVERSIGHT AND INTERVENTION OF OTHER CTLRS TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION WAS MAINTAINED; IN ADDITION; CRITICAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS ROUTINE HOLDING AND METERING HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLEX FOR THE CTLR TO HANDLE RESULTING IN DISORGANIZED AND DANGEROUS TFC SITS. ANOTHER NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR IN THE SAME AREA OF SPECIALTY HAS HAD ONE OPERROR AS A RESULT OF CTLR ERROR; AND HAS ALSO REQUIRED THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND SEPARATION DURING ROUTINE TFC SITS.

504,9500,15,ACR X DEPARTED BOS RWY 4L. FO WAS THE PF AND I WAS THE NPF. WE WERE SUCCESSIVELY GIVEN CLBS OF 4000 FT; 5000 FT ON BOS DEP FREQ 133.0. WE THEN WERE SWITCHED TO FREQ 118.25 AND WERE GIVEN CLBS OF 7000 FT AND 14000 FT (OUR FILED CRUISE ALT WAS 15000 FT). FROM ABOUT 5000 FT; WE WERE IN MODERATE TURB; SO WE WERE CLBING AT 160 KIAS AND GETTING ABOUT 2000+ FPM. CLBING THROUGH ABOUT 9500 FT; THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED: APCH CTLR (NORMAL VOICE): 'ACR X; DSND AND MAINTAIN 8000 FT.' I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE CTLR INCORRECTLY; SINCE THE CALL DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AND IT WAS SAID IN A NORMAL TONE OF VOICE. NO MENTION OF 'TFC' OR 'TFC ALERT' ON THE CTLR'S PART. CAPT SAID: 'WAS THAT FOR ACR X?' APCH CTLR (PANICKED URGENT VOICE): 'ACR X; DSND TO 8000 FT ! DSND NOW! DSND NOW!' I IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE YOKE; PITCHED DOWN 20 DEGS; PULLED THE PWR TO IDLE AND SAID 'MY CTLS;' TAKING THE ACFT FROM FO (HE HAD STARTED THE DSCNT MANEUVER; BUT NOT AS RADICALLY AS I THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE). THOUGH THE CTLR HAD NOT ONCE SAID THE WORD 'TFC;' I GLANCED AT THE TCASII IMMEDIATELY AFTER I HAD ESTABLISHED THE DIVE AND THERE WAS A TARGET OVERLAPPING WITH OUR ACFT AT THE SAME ALT (00 INDICATED AS ALT DIFFERENCE). WE WERE IN A 4000+ FPM DSCNT AND I WAS PRAYING WE WOULDN'T COLLIDE WITH THE OTHER ACFT; WHO I DETERMINED ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER (WHEN THE TCASII WAS SHOWING ABOUT 1000 FT OF VERT SEPARATION) WAS LEVEL AT 10000 FT ON AN IFR FLT PLAN. WE WERE IMC IN HVY RAIN AND MODERATE TURB; AND WE NEVER SAW THE OTHER ACFT. I WOULD ESTIMATE THERE WAS NO VERT SEPARATION AND HORIZ SEPARATION OF LESS THAN 1/4 MI. ACR X DOES NOT HAVE TCASII; AND THE TCASI NEVER SAID 'TFC; TFC' OR ANYTHING ELSE. THE UNIT TESTED OK DURING FIRST FLT CHKS AND SUBSEQUENT TESTS AFTER THE EVENT. DURING THE TIME THAT WE INITIATED OUR DSCNT UNTIL WE WERE LEVEL AT 8000 FT; THE FREQ WAS ABSOLUTELY SILENT. THE NEXT RADIO CALL WAS FROM A DIFFERENT APCH CTLR WHO HAD IMMEDIATELY STEPPED IN TO RELIEVE THE CTLR WHO HAD GIVEN US THE CLB TO 7000 FT AND 14000 FT AND ORDERED US TO DSND. THE NEW CTLR SUBSEQUENTLY CLBED US TO 14000 FT AND HANDED US OFF TO ZBW ON FREQ 128.2. WE WERE NOT WITH CTR FOR 5 MINS WHEN THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION OCCURRED: BOSTON CTR: 'ACR Y; BOSTON TRACON WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU GET ON THE GND.' ME: 'I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO THEM; TOO; DO YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER?' THIS NEAR COLLISION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY REQUIRING ALL PART 121 CARRIERS TO HAVE TCASII. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD; I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A 'MONITOR VERT SPD' OR A 'DSND; DSND' COMMAND SHORTLY AFTER PASSING 8000 FT. BECAUSE THE ACFT ONLY HAD TCASI; THERE WAS NO COMMAND GIVEN. ADDITIONALLY; THE INSTALLED TCAS UNIT FAILED TO EVEN CALL 'TFC; 'TFC' EVEN THOUGHT IT PASSED THE SELF-TEST BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT.

POINTED OUT THE TFC TO THE C130 AND HE ADVISED THE TFC IN SIGHT. WHAT CAUSED THE PROB. A COORDINATOR POS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STAFFED. SHORT STAFFING HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. THERE WERE 6 DISTRS INVOLVED IN THIS TIME FRAME THAT TOOK MY ATTN AWAY FROM MONITORING TFC. THESE INCLUDED LANDLINE QUESTIONS; A MISTAG BY ANOTHER FACILITY; A FLT OF 2 CONFLICTING WITH EACH OTHER; PLT MISSING CORRECT SQUAWK AND PLT MISSING; QUESTIONING ASSIGNED ALT.

WHAT COULD BE DONE TO PREVENT: STAFF THE COORDINATOR POS. THEY WOULD ANSWER ALL LANDLINE CALLS AND ASSIST WITH ROUTINGS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS TASKS. ALSO; THEY ARE AN EXTRA SET OF EYES.

510,3000,15,THIS FLT'S TA RESULTED FROM THE FLYING PLT LOSING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND NOT FLYING THE AIRPLANE AFTER INADVERTENTLY DISCONNECTING THE AUTOPLT WITH THE WHEEL MOUNTED SWITCH. THE FLYING PLT WAS DISTRACTED BY THE AUTOPLT CTL PANEL AND WAS HAVING ALT EXCURSIONS OF +0/-220 FT. DURING THIS TIME; I WAS LOOKING FOR TA TFC; COACHING THE PF AND ANSWERING ATC'S TFC ADVISORIES AND VECTORS.

THIS FLT'S INCIDENT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A DANGEROUS TREND THAT I HAVE NOTICED WITH EXPERIENCED PLTS FLYING MULTIPLE TYPES.

FOR EXAMPLE; ON ONE ACFT; THE TOUCH WHEEL CTL STEERING SWITCH IS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE PTT ON ANOTHER ACFT; WHICH IS THE FD COMMAND BAR SYNCH ON A THIRD ACFT. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

519,2100,8,I WAS WORKING AN ARR RUSH. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ABOUT MIDWAY THROUGH THE RUSH. I WAS FOCUSED ON VECTORING TO AS TIGHT AN INTERVAL AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID A 'DAISY CHAIN' EFFECT SLOWING THINGS DOWN. OUR AIRSPACE ENDS APPROX 15 MI FROM THE RWY THRESHOLD SO IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID LETTING THE PATTERN GET STRUNG OUT INTO THE NEXT FACILITY'S AIRSPACE. I TURNED THE B737 ONTO A BASE; POINTED OUT TFC FOR THE ACFT TO FOLLOW; AND DSNDED THE ACFT TO THE MVA IN PREPARATION FOR A VISUAL APCH. THE B737 PLT CALLED THE TFC TO FOLLOW IN SIGHT; SO I ISSUED A 10 DEG TURN TOWARD THE ARPT TO TIGHTEN THE SEQUENCE A LITTLE MORE; INSTRUCTED THE ACFT TO FOLLOW HIS TFC AND CLRED THE B737 FOR A VISUAL APCH. I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE SETTING SUN WAS BECOMING A FACTOR; BUT THE B737 PLT EXTENDED HIS BASE ACROSS THE FINAL BECAUSE HE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHERE THE RWY WAS BECAUSE THE SUN WAS IN THEIR EYES. I HAD TURNED THE F2TH'S BASE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE TOO SOON TO LEAVE ADEQUATE ROOM BEHIND THE B737 EVEN IF THE B737 HAD TURNED TO THE FINAL NORMALLY. THE B737'S FORAY ACROSS THE FINAL EXACERBATED THE PROB. I ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE TURN AWAY FROM THE B737 TO THE F2TH AND INSTRUCTED THE B737 TO TURN TOWARD THE ARPT AND MAKE A VISUAL APCH.

I HAD BEEN OUT OF WORK FOR APPROX 6 WKS DUE TO SURGERY AND HAD ACCUMULATED ABOUT 11 HRS ON POS SINCE MY RETURN TO WORK. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME IN AT LEAST 7 WKS WORKING ALL POS COMBINED. I WAS VECTORING A B737 AHEAD OF A PA31 FOR AN ILS RWY 6 TO BDL. I USED ALT SEPARATION INITIALLY AND WAS USING SPD CTL FOR SPACING ON FINAL. I ISSUED 170 KTS TO THE B737 TO THE FINAL FIX AND REDUCED THE PA31 TO 150 KTS. AFTER OBTAINING LATERAL SEPARATION; I CLRED THE BE58 FOR APCH AND THEN NOTICED THE PA31 HAD FAILED TO BLEED OFF SPD WHILE THE B737 HAD SLOWED AHEAD.

528,3000,3,I WAS THE PIC OF A FALCON 50FX ON AN IFR FLT PLAN FROM SDL TO HVN. THIS WAS THE FIRST LEG OF A 2-LEG TRIP AND BOTH PLTS HAD AN ADEQUATE REST PERIOD PRIOR TO THE FLT. CURRENT WX AT NEW HAVEN WAS WINDS 210 DEGS AT 6 KTS; CLR SKIES AND A RPTED VISIBILITY OF 6 NM IN HAZE. UPON CHKING IN WITH NEW YORK APCH; WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 20. NEARING THE NEW HAVEN AREA WE WERE AT 3000 FT AND ON A HDG OF 150 DEGS ASSIGNED AND TOLD TO RPT THE ARPT IN SIGHT. THE CTLR STATED THAT THIS HDG WOULD GIVE US A 2-3 MI FINAL. APPROX 3 MI FROM THE ARPT; WE TOLD NEW YORK THAT WE HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT. NEW YORK APCH ACKNOWLEDGED CLRED US FOR THE VISUAL APCH AND INSTRUCTED US TO SWITCH FREQS TO NEW HAVEN TWR. AFTER TRYING TO CHK IN WITH TWR ON THE NEW YORK APCH FREQ (CREW FAILED TO CHANGE TO TWR FREQ). WE THEN CHKED IN WITH NEW HAVEN TWR. WE WERE NOW APPROX 2 NM NW OF THE ARPT ON A SLIGHT R DOGLEG TO FINAL. THE TWR OPERATOR INITIALLY ASKED US FOR OUR POS AND THEN SAID THAT HE HAD US IN SIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME AS OUR ARR; 2 LIGHT SINGLE ENG ACFT WERE IN A L-HAND PATTERN MAKING TOUCH-AND-GO APCHS TO RWY 20. ONE AIRPLANE; A WARRIOR (I BELIEVE) WAS TURNING L BASE TO FINAL AS WE APCHED THE ARPT. THE TWR CTLR TOLD THE WARRIOR TO MAKER A L 360 DEG TURN FOR TFC. UPON SIGHTING THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT; WE LEVELED OFF OUR DSCNT AT 1000 FT MSL AWAITING LNDG CLRNC. ONCE THE WARRIOR BEGAN HIS L 360 DEG TURN; WE RECEIVED AN RA 'MONITOR VERT SPD.' WE CONTINUED TO FLY TOWARDS THE RWY AT 1000 FT MSL; WITHIN THE GREEN ARC CALLED FOR BY THE RA. WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR CLRNC TO LAND; WE WERE NOT IN A POS TO MAKE A SAFE LNDG SO WE REQUESTED A GAR. THE TWR CLRED US FOR A R TFC PATTERN AND WE CAME AROUND AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. FROM THE COCKPIT; THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS CONFLICT APPEAR TO BE: 1) WX. THE HAZE PREVENTED US FROM PICKING UP THE ARPT UNTIL LATER THAN NORMAL; LEADING TO A LATE HDOF FROM NEW YORK APCH TO NEW HAVEN TWR. 2) INITIAL CONFUSION FROM NEW HAVEN TWR REGARDING OUR LOCATION. WHEN CHKING IN; WE ONLY PROVIDED OUR CALL SIGN WITH NO LOCATION GIVEN; ASSUMING THAT NEW YORK APCH HAD COORD THE IFR HDOF. THIS ADDED TO THE CONFUSION OF INTEGRATING OUR IFR ARR WITH THE VFR TFC IN THE PATTERN. OUR 'LATE ARR' INTO THE TFC PATTERN MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ON THE CTLR TO SEQUENCE 2 ACFT ON SHORT APCH TO THE SAME RWY. THE RA 'MONITOR VERT SPD' ONCE AGAIN PROVES THE INCREDIBLE VALUE OF TCAS. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT A SIMILAR OUTCOME WOULD HAVE RESULTED THROUGH SEE AND AVOID; THE RA MADE THE RESOLUTION MUCH LESS STRESSFUL AND SAFER.,falcon da50 ha A tca RA dure visual apch TO hvn .

529,4500,15,WE WERE DSNDING INTO MANCHESTER ON A DOWNWIND FOR A VISUAL APCH. ON A 180 DEG HDG AND LNDG N IN MANCHESTER; I NOTICED A TARGET ON TCAS AT OUR 10-11 DEG POS. AT THE TIME I WAS ON THE 10 MI SCALE ON THE NAV DISPLAY; THEN WENT TO THE 5 NM SCALE NOTICING THE CLOSURE AND ALT SEPARATION DECREASING. THIS WAS A SITUATION WHICH WAS DETERIORATING.

I NOTICED THIS TFC LEVEL AT 5000 FT AND AM ALMOST CERTAIN IT WAS 500 FT BELOW. BEING CLRED TO 3000 FT THIS DIDN'T LOOK GOOD; I ALSO STARTED A SHALLOW TURN WBOUND. THIS ACFT WAS ALSO WBOUND. EVERYTHING WAS COMING TOGETHER. STILL NO ADVISORY. I ASKED MY COPLT TO QUERY APCH AND WHAT HE'D LIKE US TO DO. AT THIS POINT; I DON'T KNOW WHAT APCH SAID; I TOLD MY COPLT TO TELL APCH I WAS LEVELING OFF; I DID WITH A SLIGHT CLB. AT THIS POINT; I GOT THE TFC IN SIGHT. WE DID GET A TA AND RA. I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE RA SAID BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE. WITH THIS TFC BEING WBOUND; HAD I CONTINUED THE DSCNT WITH THAT TURN I MENTIONED WE WOULD HAVE COLLIDED. AFTER MY COPLT QUERIED APCH HE TOLD US TO LEVEL AT 4500 FT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT TFC'S ALT. I MENTIONED THIS ON THE RADIO. WE HAD TO ASK IF WE WERE CLRED AGAIN TO 3000 FT. THAT WAS ABOUT IT; L TURN BACK AROUND CLRED VISUAL CONTACT THE TWR. THIS HANDLING BY APCH WAS ABYSMAL. THIS WAS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION; WHERE THERE WAS A DISREGARD FOR SAFETY AND THAT SITUATION IN GENERAL; NOT MUCH INTEREST APPARENT.

530,5500,15,I FILED A VFR FLT PLAN FROM ZZZ TO PVD. ETE 3 HRS 40 MINS. I DEPARTED ZZZ AROUND XA30. I OPENED MY FLT PLAN WITH FSS. FOR MOST OF THE TRIP I WAS MAINTAINING 5500 FT. I CLBED TO 7500 FT; BUT DECIDED THE WINDS WERE BETTER LOWER; SO I RETURNED TO 5500 FT MSL. I FOLLOWED THE SAME HDG FOR 2.5 HRS AND WAS IN CONSTANT COMS WITH ATC (FROM STATION-TO-STATION) UNTIL MOMENTS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. I CLRLY RECALL TALKING WITH ALBANY AND THEY HANDED ME OFF TO BRADLEY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CONTACTED BRADLEY ATC. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT MY GPS AND SEEING THAT I WAS 76 NM FROM PVD; I TUNED-IN PVD APCH; TWR AND ATIS TO DETERMINE I SHOULD EXPECT AS AN APCH TO HELP PVD WITH LNDG SEQUENCING. IT WAS AT THIS TIME I SAW SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKIES AHEAD OF ME. IT WAS ABOUT 10-15 DEGS TO THE L OF MY HDG (OF APPROX 115 DEGS); ABOUT 1/2 MI AHEAD AND SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN MY ALT. I QUICKLY REALIZED IT WAS A PARACHUTE JUMPER. HE HAD AN OPEN CANOPY AND WAS NOW DOING A TWIST/TURN MANEUVER TO FURTHER INCREASE THE DISTANCE AND PATH ANGLE BTWN HIMSELF AND ME. RECOGNIZING I HAD WANDERED INTO AN ACTIVE DROP ZONE AND FEARING OTHER JUMPERS MAY BE ABOVE ME IN BLIND SPOTS; SEEING THE CLR PATH AHEAD OF ME AND A GENEROUS HIGH AND WIDE 'TUNNEL OF AIRSPACE' IN FRONT OF ME; I DECIDED TO MAKE A SLIGHT (1 OR 2 DEG) VEER TO MY R (AWAY FROM THE JUMPER) AND CONTINUE A FORWARD; STRAIGHT AND LEVEL EXIT OUT OF THE JUMP ZONE WHILE SITTING FAR FORWARD IN MY SEAT TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE; UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE CLR AREA AHEAD OF ME. I FELT IF I HAD MADE SUDDEN; DRAMATIC; EVASIVE MANEUVERS IN THE JUMP ZONE TO AVOID THE ONE JUMPER WHO I COULD CLRLY SEE; I WOULD HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE RISK TO OTHER JUMPERS HAD THEY BEEN IN THE SAME AIRSPACE. I FELT A STEADY; STRAIGHT AND LEVEL EXIT FROM THE JUMP ZONE WAS THE BEST AND SAFEST SITUATION. AT THIS TIME THE CESSNA CARAVAN 208B (JUMP PLANE) WAS APPROX 1000-2000 FT ABOVE ME AND PERFORMING A VERY STEEP TURN. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW HE WAS FLYING FROM R TO L. MOMENTS LATER; WHILE I WAS MAKING MY EXIT OUT OF THE JUMP ZONE THIS CESSNA HAD CIRCLED ME AND WAS NOW 100 FT OFF MY R WINGTIP. I'M SURE HE WAS FUMING MAD AND WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE HIS FRUSTRATION WITH ME. I DIDN'T SEE THE PLT AS I WAS STUNNED TO SEE SUCH A LARGE ACFT SUDDENLY APPEAR ALONGSIDE OF ME; AND I WAS STILL SO THROWN (AND PUMPED WITH ADRENALINE) RECOUNTING THE DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT I'D PLACED MYSELF AND THE JUMPER(S) INTO. I REALIZED AT THIS POINT MY RADIO WAS TUNED TO ALBANY; NOT BRADLEY ATC. I CHANGED FREQS AND TALKED WITH BRADLEY ATC. THEY IMMEDIATELY SAID; 'ACFT X; WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU FOR 15 MI.' I REPLIED 'I LOST COMS.' THEY ASKED IF I SAW THE JUMPER. I REPLIED 'AFFIRMATIVE; I SAW THE JUMPER.' SHORTLY AFTER THIS THEY PASSED ME OVER TO ZBW. FROM THIS POINT; IT BECAME A PRETTY ROUTINE LNDG AT PVD; BUT I WAS THOROUGHLY DISTR BY THE JUMP ZONE INCIDENT AND THE CESSNA 208B ALONGSIDE OF ME. AFTER PARKING AT FBO; I CALLED FSS TO REVIEW MY FLT PATH AND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY TFR'S ALONG MY COURSE. THE ANSWER WAS NO. I THEN DROVE TO FBO #2 AND SPOKE WITH A CFI. I EXPLAINED WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. HE EXPLAINED LOST COMS AND LOST SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS MY FAULT AS PIC. HE ADVISED I SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME REVIEWING MY FLT PLANS AND BEING AWARE OF MY INTENDED AND ACTUAL FLT PATH -- WHICH I WILL. HOWEVER; BRADLEY ATC; KNOWING THEY COULDN'T VERBALLY CONTACT ME FOR 15 MI AND COULD SEE I WAS ON A STRAIGHT AND STEADY HDG (AT APPROX 120 KTS) AT APPROX 115 DEGS AT 5500 FT FOR QUITE A WHILE -- LEADING RIGHT INTO THE ACTIVE JUMP ZONE; DIDN'T NOTIFY THE CESSNA 208B JUMP PLANE. IN THIS SHARED 'SEE AND AVOID' AIRSPACE THE JUMP PLANE ALLOWED JUMPERS TO LEAP FROM HIS PLANE. WHY DIDN'T BRADLEY ATC ASK THE JUMP PLANE TO WAIT A MIN OR TWO UNTIL I WAS THROUGH THE AREA? WHY DIDN'T THE JUMP PLANE SEE ME? I EVEN CALLED A C206 JUMP PLANE PLT TO DISCUSS THIS EVENT. HE AGREED THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT IS A SHARED AIRSPACE. EVEN A BARE BONES PIPER J-3 CUB (WITH NO RADIOS AND NO XPONDER) IS PERMITTED TO PASS DIRECTLY THROUGH THE JUMP ZONE. IT'S NOT ADVISABLE BUT IT'S STILL FAA LEGAL. NO ONE WAS INJURED. HOWEVER; THIS WAS FAR TOO CLOSE FOR ME. I WILL SPEND MORE TIME REVIEWING MY FLT PATH AND ENSURING I'M TUNED INTO TO CORRECT FREQS. I AM A SAFE PLT. I AM BETTER THAN WHAT I EXHIBITED ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. I'VE BEEN FLYING FOR 4.5 YRS AND I FEEL I'M A MORE 'AWARE' AND CAPABLE PLT THAN OTHER PLTS I KNOW.

535,24000,10,I WAS WORKING A RADAR ASSOCIATE POS AT A HIGH ALT SECTOR AT ZBW (RA46). TFC WAS LIGHT; NO COMPLEXITY. THE RADAR CTLR ACCEPTED A HDOF ON A C130 APPROX 45 MI PRIOR TO OUR AIRSPACE AT FL240. PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT; THE RADAR CTLR IDENTED A TRACK; AN E135 LNDG BOS; APPROX 20 MI W OF THE C130. THE E145 WAS AT FL280 WITH THE DATA BLOCK SHOWING A CLRNC TO 11000 FT. THE C130 AND E145 WERE ON CONVERGING COURSES. NEITHER ACFT WERE IN OUR DELEGATED AIRSPACE. THE SECTORS IN THAT AREA ARE FL230 AND BELOW (SECTOR 36) AND FL240 AND ABOVE (SECTOR 38). PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT; SECTOR 38 CALLED ME TO TURN THE C130 30 DEGS TO THE L. THE E145 WAS STILL FL260 DSNDING; BEING WORKED BY SECTOR 36. I PASSED THE INFO TO MY RADAR CTLR. MY RADAR CTLR THEN TURNED THE C130 IMMEDIATELY 40 DEGS AS IT APPEARED SEPARATION WAS IN QUESTION. I OBSERVED THE E145 TURNING HARD L AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. SEPARATION WAS LOST; 4.97 MI AND 300 FT. HUMAN FACTORS: THE RADAR CTLR AND I WERE NEARING THE END OF OUR DAY. IN RECENT MONTHS; WE ARE ROUTINELY ASSIGNED OPERATING POS THAT HAVE LITTLE MEANINGFUL WORK. BOREDOM AND STRESS OF ENDURING LONG PERIODS ON A POS WITH LITTLE TO DO. MENTALLY GETTING THROUGH A SHIFT HAS BECOME A TRUE CHALLENGE. IN THIS INCIDENT; 6 CTLRS WERE REMOVED FROM POS TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. MY SECTOR WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SEPARATING THESE 2 ACFT.

536,13000,15,THE SECTOR COMPLEXITY WAS LESS THAN MODERATE WITH STANDARD LOGAN; PROVIDENCE AND BRADLEY TERMINAL ARRS AND DEPS. WX WAS NOT AN ISSUE OR A FACTOR IN THIS ERROR. THIS SECTOR; THE BOSOX SECTOR; POS 47; AT ZBW; IS ABLE TO USE REDUCED SEPARATION STANDARDS BELOW CLASS A AIRSPACE (3 NM) DUE TO SINGLE-SITE ADAPTATION UTILIZING A MIXTURE OF SINGLE-SITE ADAPTED ARSR AND ASR-9 TERMINAL SENSORS. SENSOR FAILURES OR MAINT SCHEDULES THAT TAKE SENSORS OUT OF THE SYS DISABLE VARIOUS PORTIONS OF THE SECTOR FOR REDUCED SEPARATION STANDARDS. REGRETTABLY; DUE TO HUMAN ERROR; I USED LTSS IN AN ENTIRELY CTLED MANNER BTWN ACR X AND ACR Y (BOTH ACFT WERE PROCEEDING IN THE SAME DIRECTION (NW) AT ATC ASSIGNED SPDS (250 KTS) WHEN THE COV (COVENTRY; RHODE ISLAND) ASR-9 WAS OTS DUE TO FAILURE). BECAUSE COV WAS OTS THE REQUIRED SEPARATION WAS 5 NM; IF COV HAD BEEN IN SVC THEN 3 NM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE STANDARD SEPARATION. THE ABILITY OF ENRTE ATC TO USE REDUCED SEPARATION STANDARDS IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER TRADITIONAL DECADES OLD PROCS; HOWEVER; SINCE THE INSTALLATION OF URET (USER REQUEST EVALUATION TOOL); THE SECTOR INFO AREA (SIA) WHERE INFO PERTINENT TO THE SECTOR OP IS MAINTAINED HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN.

I WAS INSTRUCTED TO ENTER A L BASE FOR RWY 24 AND CALL MIDFIELD. (I SENSED THERE WAS A TRAINEE IN THE TWR. I HEARD ANOTHER ACFT GIVEN INSTRUCTION TO ENTER A 'L BASE' FOR RWY 24 AS THAT ACFT WAS ARRIVING FROM THE SE.) I WAS THEN INSTRUCTED TO ENTER A 'R' DOWNWIND FOR RWY 24. I WAS STILL OUT FAR ENOUGH SO THAT WASN'T A PROB. I WAS DSNDING TO TPA OF 1100 FT (L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 24) AND JUST ARRIVED AT ALT IN THE PATTERN WHEN A CE402 JUST MISSED HITTING US AFTER DEPARTING RWY 24 AND GIVEN A R TURN. I CALLED THE TWR AND ASKED IF THEY HAD THAT TFC AS I NEVER HEARD A CALL AND THEY REPLIED IT WAS VFR AND NOW 10 NM N. I SAID I NEVER HEARD A CALL AND WHY WAS IT GIVEN A R TURN DIRECTLY INTO ME? AT THIS POINT A NEW CTLR STEPPED IN AND STATED THE PLANE WAS VFR. WHEN I TAXIED INTO THE FBO THE DESK MGR HEARD THE ENTIRE COM AND WAS AS CONCERNED AS I. I THEN CALLED THE TWR MGR AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE COULDN'T VERIFY THE INCIDENT AS THE TAPE WAS DOWN ALL DAY (HOW VERY CONVENIENT). THERE WERE 2 WITNESSES TO THIS INCIDENT. ONE WAS AT THE FBO WHO HEARD THE COM AND THE SECOND WAS MY PAX. WHAT I BELIEVE CAUSED THE PROB WAS A NEW CTLR/TRAINEE ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS TO THE DEPARTING C402 TO MAKE A R TURN AND LACKED AWARENESS OF MY POS ENTERING THE PATTERN. THE SECOND WAS THE CE402 PLT'S IRRESPONSIBILITY TO LOOKING AND AVOIDING TFC. WE SPOTTED HIM; TOO LATE FOR ANY EVASIVE ACTION; AS LUCKILY THE SEPARATION PREVENTED A MIDAIR.

539,9500,2,PROCEEDING INBOUND ON THE ARR IN VMC. APPROX 40 MI E OF PVD I MENTIONED TO THE FO (WHO WAS FLYING FROM THE L SEAT) 'CTR NEEDS TO GET US DOWN TO 11000 FT; IF WE ARE TO MAKE PVD AT 11000 FT.' THE CTLR WAS BUSY; SO I DIDN'T INTERRUPT. FINALLY THE CTLR ASKED US IF HE HAD 'GIVEN US 11000 FT AT PVD.' I REPLIED 'NEGATIVE THIS IS THE FIRST MENTION OF THAT.' THE ZBW CTLR APOLOGIZED FOR THE LATE DSCNT AND CLRED US TO CROSS 5 MI E OF PVD AT 11000 FT INSTEAD OF 11000 FT. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE I SET 11000 FT IN THE ALT ALERT DEVICE; AND WE BOTH SAID '11000 SEEN.' HOWEVER; AFTER PASSING 10000 FT WE BOTH SAW 6000 SET IN THE ALERTER. I DON'T KNOW HOW 6000 WAS SET; NOR DO I RECALL SETTING SUCH A NUMBER IN THE ALERTER. THE ONLY 'SIX' IN OUR CLRNC WAS 'ALTIMETER OF 30.06.' THE ONLY POSSIBILITY THAT I CAN THINK OF; IS THAT SOMEHOW; IN THE HASTE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LATE DSCNT NOTICE; POSSIBLY I TRANSPOSED THE 30.06 INTO THE 6 IN THE ALT ALERTER. DURING THE DSCNT IT WAS NECESSARY TO ATTAIN 4000 FPM IN ORDER TO MEET THE NOW IMPOSED RESTR. AIRBRAKE ONE POS WAS USED. I MENTIONED TO THE FO THAT 'IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO SLOW TO 250 KIAS BY PVD SINCE THAT RESTR WAS NOT ISSUED.' SHORTLY BEFORE THAT I SAW THE 6000 FT IN THE ALT ALERT DEVICE. PASSING THROUGH 10000 FT WE GOT AN 'RA' WITH THE TFC IN SIGHT; WHEN THE CTLR QUERIED OUR ALT; THEN CLRED US TO 9000 FT WE THEN CONTINUED TO BOSTON LOGAN UNEVENTFULLY. I ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ACTIONS. IN RETROSPECT; I BELIEVE THAT I ERRED IN JUDGEMENT; MOST LIKELY DUE TO FATIGUE. THE FOLLOWING APPLIES: I WAS ABLE TO SLEEP ONLY ABOUT 4-4.5 HRS LAST NIGHT. NORMALLY I SLEEP ABOUT 8 HRS PER NIGHT. ON THIS NIGHT WE HAD THE MINIMUM LEGAL REST. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY HOTEL ROOM TO GET SLEEP. UPON ARRIVING AT MY ROOM I DISCOVERED THAT THE ROOM'S OUTSIDE DOOR CONNECTING TO A COMMON OUTDOOR DECK WOULD NOT LOCK OR CLOSE. SINCE ANYONE HAD ACCESS TO THE AREA; I FELT UNSAFE TRYING TO SLEEP WITH THE PEDESTRIAN TFC NEARBY WITH THE WIND BLOWING THE DOOR OPEN. THEREFORE; I ASKED FOR ANOTHER ROOM; WHICH TOOK ABOUT 45 MINS TO ARRANGE. UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY REPLACEMENT ROOM WAS NEAR AN ELEVATOR ON THE THIRD FLOOR. THIS ELEVATOR WAS IN USE FREQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WITH NOISY TOURISTS; PASSING IN AND ABOUT; WHO REPEATEDLY WOKE ME UP. THE NEXT DAY; I DID NOT REALIZE MY FATIGUE STATE.

551,1000,0,THE AREA FROM FSO TO OGS IS INUNDATED WITH EXCESS RADIO TFC ON CHANNELS 122.80 AND 123.00 COMING FROM CANADIAN ARPTS. THE CARP ARPT (CYRP) IS THE MAIN OFFENDER SINCE A LOT OF PRIMARY TRAINING TAKES PLACE AT THIS ARPT. THE CANADIAN WAY OF CALLING TFC AT UNCONTROLLED ARPTS IS LONG-WINDED AT THE LEAST AND EXTREMELY EXCESSIVE IN MOST CASES. A RECENT EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS AFFECTS OPERATIONS OCCURRED OVER OGS. A COMMUTER WAS DEPARTING WHILE I WAS PASSING IN THE VICINITY OF THE ARPT AND I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE COMMUTER'S TAXI AND DEPARTING TFC CALLS ON 122.80 DUE TO CONSTANT TFC COMING FROM CYRP. CONDITIONS WERE CAVU AND I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE COMMUTER TAXI ONTO THE RWY AND AVOID AN INCIDENT.

552,2700,4.5,I was established on final; Runway 36 at LEB on about a 4-5 miles final over the 'microwave tower;' and had been cleared to land. Altitude was about 2;700 - 3;000 FT MSL; descending on the PAPI. Prior to entering the Class D; Tower had called traffic as an 'EMS helicopter (2) southbound;' and correspondingly called out a twin on final for Runway 36 as traffic for EMS. EMS responded 'traffic in sight' and I responded as looking. I was unable to see the traffic until it was necessary to maneuver the aircraft to the east (toward Croydon and Grafton Mountains). The helicopter's lights were 'blended' with the city of Lebanon in the background. I suspect this was because as they passed I noticed they had their nose search light on; but pointed toward the ground. This large white light blocked out the helicopter's other lights and made it appear as another bright white light in the city of Lebanon. At the prior described location; I noticed that we were on a near-head-on collision course; and maneuvered the aircraft with about 30 degrees of bank and about 1/2 mile to the east (right turn) of centerline to avoid the traffic. Upon landing; I had 2 of the 9 passengers ask what was up with the helicopter flying so close to us and few others exclaim that they were wondering why we suddenly banked sharply. I estimate the distance between aircraft was 350-500 FT. After landing; I asked ATC if the helicopters used the call sign 'Life Guard' or were always considered as a 'Life Guard' flight. The reply is that they are only considered as 'Life Guard' when they use those words; which they were not at this time. As a result; I believe they were in violation of the right-of-way rules (FAR 91.113) and caused a commercial flight to break off of visual approach guidance and to deviate toward rising terrain. I was in an aircraft with a Garmin GNS 430 and happened to have it selected to the terrain page with 120 Arc. I saw a lot of yellow. I reestablished on final and landed without any further incident.,A commerci light twin experienc nmac em helicopt a night visual approach leb .

553,1500,2.5,I was flying a helicopter for video work in the Boston area. Initially; we transited the Class B south of the airspace. Then transited back from the south to the north for some more work; just outside to the Bravo on the north side. I told the Tower; although outside of the airspace we would continue to monitor with them. After completing that work; the customer asked us to video tape some activity at the state house; which borders the Boston Common. I called the Tower; requested clearance back into the Bravo for that destination. I was then cleared to do so. I then requested to operate at 1;500 FT. The normal altitude is 1;000. I was also cleared for this. Approximately 2 miles west of our destination; I called the Tower and requested to hold between the Boston Common and the 8 DME to the west for noise abatement; while we were waiting for the event to start. I was cleared for that request. Upon reaching the Boston Common; I started to make a 180 degree turn back to the west and head for the 8 DME. The controller then pointed out traffic departing Logan. While I was looking for the traffic the Controller questioned where I was working; which was well inside the boundaries that I had requested and was cleared for. He said that I could not be off the departure end of the runway at that altitude and must descend to 800 FT. After clearing beneath me; I started a descent to 800 FT. I then questioned the controller about the altitude. I thought I may have missed something in the earlier clearance. But I am 99% sure that I did not. We work regularly at the altitude of 1;500 over the Boston Common with 27 and 33 departures. The only thing that I can think of is that the controller was not familiar with the site picture from the Tower. And again the Controller was working two frequencies at the same time. Looking back; as busy as he was; I am not sure he was completely aware of what he was clearing me for. To help this situation; I feel that the Controller should have taken a minute to clarify in his own mind what I was going to do and if not; question it before we got there. Also; when there is the slightest doubt that the controller is not understanding what he is clearing me for; I will reconfirm the clearance with them; no matter how often and normal a particular request is.,helicopt pilot request clearanc into bo class B airspac over downtown area 1 ; 500 FT which is grant by tower . report is later instruct descend 800 FT by tower ; cite conflict runway 27 departur .

554,15000,25,We were approaching JUMPR intersection from the north and had been cleared to 15;000'.  Boston Center informed us that we would get cleared higher when past an Airbus that was east of us at 16;000' and converging.  We both saw the Airbus on what appeared to be a parallel ground track.  We reported the Airbus in sight and Boston cleared us to climb to 17;000' and maintain visual separation. As we continued to climb; I realized that the Airbus was stationary in the side window and getting closer.  About the time I suggested to my First Officer that we level off below his altitude; we got a TCAS RA aural warning directing us to monitor vertical speed and visual display showing us to maintain level flight or descend.  We stopped climbing and leveled off at 15;200'. We reported to Boston that we had leveled off; that we had been responding to an RA; and that our intention was to maintain our altitude until we had passed behind the other aircraft. We passed a couple of hundred yards behind and about 800 feet below the Airbus soon afterwards.  Once clear on the left side of the Airbus; with a diverging vector; we continued our climb to 17;000'. The Boston Center Controller asked us how close the RA had been and I answered '800 ft below.'  He said 'no problem' and shortly cleared us for an early turn on course. In light of the difficulty of estimating range visually to another aircraft; we should have monitored the map display to assess lateral separation and lateral closure. That would have indicated to us that we should have shallowed out our climb to let the other aircraft pass across our nose and to increase lateral separation before climbing through within 1000 feet of its altitude.,A b737 crew report climb atc clearanc 17 ; 000 ' . cross traffic 16 ; 000 ' wa sight but report unabl determin traffic separ altitud level 15 ; 200 ' respons a tca RA .

555,26000,20,While providing training at the Athens and Camebridge sectors (38/39); my trainee tried to get the business jet below an Air Carrier to facilitate his landing at BVY.  The control instructions were not sufficient to maintain separation due to high tail winds and too small of a vector off course.  The initial vectors were only 15 degrees and then an additional 10 degrees; these vectors were issued to both aircraft but not in a timely enough fashion.  As separation was being lost; I asked the business jet to verify leaving flight level 260 but the transmission was blocked; I immediately requested the same information and received the report at which time business jet was told to resume his previous route.

556,5000,15,Upon checking in with Bradley Approach we were initially told to expect Runway 33 ILS. I requested Runway 24 and we were granted that request.  The Controller gave us an eastbound vector and descended us to 5000'. (May have been 6000' can't recall.)  We were being vectored in from the northwest on a right base to join the ILS to 24.  At approximately 15-20 miles northwest of Runway 24 while level at our assigned altitude; I began to hear a roaring noise.  My initial thought was that there was another aircraft in our near vicinity.  I scanned the TCAS readout and saw no Traffic Advisories. I scoped down to a smaller range and still saw nothing. I scanned outside but did not see any traffic.  We were in and out of the clouds (broken clouds; 2000-3000 foot thick) and while visibility was good between the clouds; I was unable to pick up the traffic visually.  The Captain and I commented something to the effect that there is another airplane and he's got to be right on top of us. Just then I noticed the first illumination of a TA on our TCAS.  It was a white +003 directly on top of the aircraft symbol.  The TCAS never gave us any RAs. I queried the Approach Controller saying; 'Do you have traffic on top of us?' The Controller did not seem very concerned and said that there were a pair of F-15s departing Barnes (which I believe we were directly south of at the time).  He also said that we were in a heavy military operations area and left it at that. He did not offer any more information about the separation we had with the departing fighters.  The roar of the passing F-15s lasted somewhere between five and seven seconds.The remainder of the flight was uneventful. My concern is that we were not given adequate separation from the departing F-15s. I suppose that it is possible to hear passing aircraft while in flight and still have adequate separation; but I highly doubt that is the case here.  The sound from the fighters was at least as loud if not louder than when you are holding short of 12R in STL and an F-15 is launching right in front of you.  And the noise lasted for a sustained seven seconds or so. I am curious to know what kind of separation we were given.  I feel that it is highly likely that an ATC error or F-15 Pilot error may have reduced our separation.  Because of the IMC conditions and insufficient TCAS Advisories; I believe that we were completely at the mercy of ATC in this situation.  I do not think there is anything we could have done to increase the separation between us and the departing F-15s. I think that ATC could have issued Traffic Advisories and may have needed to provide greater separation.,carrier flight crew report a nmac f15 near bdl imc . onli A tca TA wa indic atc did not issu a traffic advisori . upon check bradley approach initi told expect runway 33 il .

558,900,1,While conducting an operation on Martha's Vineyard; we had a near miss about 1 mile north of the Runway 24 centerline. We started in the west end of island making north to south tracks. As we approached the Class D airspace we increased our communication with the Tower informing them where we were at all times. We were squawking a discreet code. We were cleared several times to cross airport at 900 FT by the Tower Operator. Traffic was very light. I remember one other aircraft in the area. I heard him over the airport. Not sure of altitude but high. We were on our 2nd or 3rd pass north to south. We encountered traffic while flying north at 900 FT. The conflicting traffic was at our 12 o'clock position and maybe 50 FT above us. His gear was down he was roughly on right base leg for Runway 24. I do not believe he saw us; neither the pilot in command nor Tower Operator made any comment about the near miss. We did not either. 1) We did not hear any warning from Tower that we had conflicting traffic approaching us. 2) I heard Tower Operator indicate to other aircraft that Tower radar was giving him trouble. 3) This was second Tower Operator we worked with. First was a female; second operator was a male voice. We had been talking to the male operator for at least 45 minutes prior to the incident. Contributing factors: 1) I am not sure what was happening in the Tower Cab; it did not appear Tower Operator had a working radar otherwise we never would have gotten this close based on past experience. 2) We had three qualified pilots in my aircraft. No one heard the other aircraft on the frequency. 3) I believe the other aircraft was being operated by an air carrier based on the type and color of aircraft.

559,1000,5,In BOS at the time of the occurance; Tower was departing to the north and arriving to the west. My route of flight was southeast. I was cleared via VFR route B; which is at or below 1;000 FT. I departed to the north; turned north to east to see the arriving traffic for Runway 27. Once I had the aircraft in sight which would be a factor; I was cleared on course. The aircraft on final are advised of my position and that I have them in sight maintaining visual. I passed an arriving passenger airliner rather closely and apparently they had an alert which caused them to go missed. Since the incident; if BOS Tower is departing to the north and arriving to the west; I depart IFR to avoid a similar incident.

560,900,2,[We were] making straight in to Runway 29 following the RNAV 29 procedure. Tower asked for distance call outs which we provided. Other traffic on right downwind was told they would be number two behind us. Other traffic was given a left 360 turn back on to downwind. We did not hear this instruction to the other traffic. We were on the descent to Runway 29 and at about two miles (900 FT); the other aircraft appeared at 12 o'clock and maybe 200 FT above; wings level. Aircraft was not seen before it was very close. Bottom of aircraft was dirty white and clouds were gray. Aircraft passed overhead before I could take evasive action. I immediately notified the Tower that traffic had just passed directly over us. After landing; on Ground Control; I advised the Tower I would call them on the land line. Called Tower and spoke to manager. A while later; I received a call from the aircraft owner; he said the pilot was still flying.Almost an hour later; I received a call from the pilot. We talked about the incident. The pilot is not from this area and did not seem familiar with the area. His location on the downwind put him over the waters of Long Island Sound so he had very little ground reference for his 360 turn back on to the down wind. I asked him about the wind and he stated 340 at 6. We discussed the wind at pattern altitude and I suggested it might be much stronger and more from the North (local knowledge). He agreed the wind and lack of ground references over the water could have allowed him to drift down wind during his 360 turn on downwind. The lack of RADAR at this airport was a direct factor in this NMAC! The FAA commitment to install RADAR in 1994 has still not been fulfilled! I have been a pilot for over 50 years.  This is my fourth NMAC at this airport! Three of the four NMAC's have occurred since 1994; when the FAA said they would install RADAR. All three would have been prevented with RADAR in the Tower!

561,2000,3,Our aircraft was in a VFR descent for the Nantucket airport. Nantucket ATIS was reporting that Runways 24 and 30 were in use for arrivals and Runway 15 for VFR departures. Nantucket Tower was also on dual control. At about 15 miles away from our arrival airport Cape Approach; who was giving us flight following; handed us off to the Nantucket Tower. Upon checking in with the first Tower frequency; we were told to fly the northern shoreline for a right base entry for Runway 24. We were also advised that we were to follow a Piper Malibu in to the airport by the Nantucket Tower. After acquiring the aircraft we were to follow for Runway 24 I continued to finish checklists and set up the aircraft for our arrival in to the airport. At this point the pilot flying was scanning the area for traffic and then observed another aircraft at our 2 to 3 o'clock position about 30 - 50 FT off our right wing and no more than 100 FT below our current altitude. Seeing our aircraft was in a descent we were set for a collision course with the other aircraft. The pilot flying called traffic then started an abrupt climb to avoid the aircraft. After clearing the outbound traffic we reported the traffic to the Tower. Tower reported that they did not have a transponder return from the aircraft. Therefore we never received a traffic call or a TCAS report from our aircraft. We also did not hear any communication with the aircraft. 1) Nantucket Tower did not advise of any conflicting traffic. 2) The aircraft either did not have transponder on or was not functioning properly. 3) Departures off of Runway 15 were being told to make right turn and fly overhead to the north to avoid IFR departing traffic on Runway 24; but into VFR arrivals for Runway 24.,A flight crew report a near miss approach ack anoth aircraft which depart but no transpond not talk atc . aircraft wa a vfr descent nantucket airport . nantucket ati wa report that runway 24 30 use arriv runway 15 vfr departur . nantucket tower wa also dual control .

562,1100,1,I was the second departure in a series of four: another piston single; me; followed by a turbo prop and a small jet. I was on an instrument flight plan and cleared to depart Runway 29 with a left turn to 250 issued at the hold line. The Tower alerted me to traffic in bound traffic for the left downwind. I departed and; at roughly 1;100 MSL; I initiated my left turn to 250. BED Tower then gave me an immediate hand-off to Boston Approach. As I was tuning the radio to 124.4 I lowered the nose to check for traffic. I then saw a [high wing light aircraft] zip by at roughly 500 FT horizontal distance and roughly 150 to 200 FT vertical distance. The [other aircraft] didn't appear to have taken any evasive action. I did not either; as we were on nearly orthogonal courses. Neither Bedford Tower before the hand off nor Boston Approach after the hand off called any specific traffic. On my departure I never had the downwind traffic BED Tower called out in sight. I also never told them I had the traffic. They passed the traffic alert with my departure clearance while I was still on the ground holding short of Runway 29. Despite being a flight instructor; and having reminded trainees on many occasions that departing an IFR flight plan doesn't relieve the pilot of full traffic awareness when in VMC; I allowed my focus on IFR procedures during a VMC departure from an unfamiliar airport to interfere with and reduce the amount of time I spent looking out of the windows for traffic. I was focused on my vectors to the BOSOX Intersection; the hand off to Boston Approach and not enough on looking for traffic. I am glad that I lowered the nose and took a look; but overall my eyes were inside too much. Also; as I have told many trainees; the pilot workload is higher for an IFR departure in VMC because you have to do all the IFR cockpit tasks; but also all the VFR traffic avoidance tasks. I am lucky that we missed each other. This experience is a valuable personal teaching moment and one that I can use constructively with my students.,A pa28 pilot report airborn conflict anoth light aircraft a short flight bed bo . crowd airspac wa a contribut factor .

563,3500,3,I was flying a Cherokee southeast bound at 3;500 FT on a flight from 2B3 to ASH. When I passed abeam of 8B1; I began verifying frequencies on my charts and tuning radios in preparation for contacting Boston Approach. I was required to contact Boston Approach because our route of flight would take us through the edge of Manchester Class C airspace prior to entering Nashua Class D. While I was performing this task; a passenger remarked that there was a 'big airplane to our right.' I looked up and saw a single-engine retractable-gear converging at my 1 o'clock and about a half mile; northeast bound; at or slightly above my altitude. I immediately pitched down and turned to the right so as to pass below and behind the converging traffic. The other airplane made no apparent change in altitude indicated 3;100 FT; so our vertical separation was about 400 FT and I estimated our horizontal separation was about the same. Both aircraft were operating at the appropriate altitude for the direction of flight. The aircraft to my right had the right of way and thanks to my observant passenger I was able to see and yield to that aircraft. Upon reflection however; there are still lessons to be learned:1. A traffic alert system; whether an on-board electronic system; ATC flight following; or an observant passenger; contributes to the see and avoid concept and greatly increases safety.2. Complex cockpit tasks; such as finding and tuning multiple radio frequencies should be divided into smaller tasks so that the pilot can avoid longer periods of 'head-down' time and thereby scan for traffic more frequently; and3. Although pilots receive training in scanning for traffic and practice maneuvers that require immediate pilot input; such as go-arounds; stall recover; and recovery from critical attitudes; at no time can I remember receiving training in traffic avoidance maneuvers at cruise speeds. Such training might be beneficial. Of course; it would always be better to practice items 1 & 2 and resolve conflicts sooner.,A pa28 passeng detect converg traffic 3 ; 500 FT near 8b1 as pilot wa look chart frequenc so pilot took evas action avoid other aircraft by 400 FT .

564,750,2,After taking off from Runway 23 on an IFR flight I was cleared to climb on runway heading to 2;000 MSL. While climbing through 750 MSL TCAS called traffic dead ahead about the same time as we spotted a high wing Cessna right ahead. We broke right and narrowly avoided him. We had had no warning from tower about potential conflict. The Controller was very busy with many aircraft in training situations entering and exiting [his airspace]. In talking to the Tower supervisor later it appears the Cessna was on a practice approach and drifted across the end of the runway. I don't think the Tower controller should have allowed practice approaches (to another runway!) during such a busy time. He should have appreciated that they could drift into a conflict and should have warned me of the potential.One additional factor is that the Lancair Evolution is a very high performance airplane and the Controller may have been unfamiliar and not realized how fast we would go once released.,A lancair pilot depart a ifr flight plan experienc nmac a cessna singl fli a practic approach a differ runway . after take off runway 23 ifr flight I wa clear climb runway head 2 ; 000 msl . climb through 750 msl tca call traffic dead ahead about same time as spot a high wing cessna right ahead .

565,5000,5,I was returning from a VFR cross country flight with a friend in the passenger seat. Our plane was had a Garmin GNS430 and a Mode C transponder; we were using the CTAF frequency at PYM at the time. We were planning on entering the traffic pattern at PYM. There was a lot of aircraft flying in under 2;000 FT MSL. A plane called a 4 mile final into Runway 15; we were close to that area and we decided to do a climbing turn to look for the traffic. The winds started to shift to favor [Runway] 24 but the other aircraft in the pattern were not changing runways. We decided to climb up to about 5;000 FT MSL over the shore line and do a few practice maneuvers to wait and let the other aircraft land or change runways.We did our clearing turns and did a few chandelles; steep turns; and lazy eights. On the last lazy eight; as we're returning to wings level we see an aircraft fly very close right under our left wing. It seemed to be about 300 FT below us and within 200 FT horizontally; it might have been closer; but at the rate that it flew under us it was very difficult to tell. I applied full power and made a 60 degree bank right turn immediately to try to avoid this aircraft. We thought it was a light twin. It looked like it made no efforts to evade us. They must have been on with ATC; as they were at 5;000 FT going at least 150 KTS; which would put them in the Boston Bravo in a matter of minutes. After this event; the pattern was clear and we made an uneventful landing. I don't know what was going on in the other aircraft; but with the changing attitude of my aircraft in the lazy eight; and the closing speed of the conflicting traffic; left for about a second to react and turn. The light twin being fast; relatively small; and in the blind spot under our nose was able to get too close without us seeing them. ADS-B would have been invaluable in this situation; as we would be able to see the other aircraft on the display quicker and easier than trying to spot it whilst performing a maneuver.,A pilot practic profici maneuv 5 ; 000 FT prior a vfr approach pym ha a near miss aircraft which he assum wa ifr becaus it wa not pym ctaf .

566,1100,1,I was working Cape Approach while enroute to MVY from the southwest. Cape handed me off to the tower who advised me to report a right downwind entry. From my direction of flight a right base would have been a better line up. I requested a right base and was granted same.  There were multiple aircraft in the area to both land and takeoff. It became clear as I approached that a right base would put me in conflict with another aircraft on a right base further out to my left. I advised the tower that I thought a right downwind would in fact be better and he concurred and I altered course for the right downwind. While on approach and established parallel to the runway on the right downwind at or near pattern altitude the tower controller requested I extend my downwind for other aircraft. I acknowledged same. In a split second out of the corner of my eye I saw another aircraft to my left (Aircraft Y) on a right base. Aircraft Y passed underneath me by a very slim margin; less than 200 feet; perhaps less than 100 feet. It was very quick. If we had been at the same altitude we would have collided. I advised the tower controller of the event and the only response was 'that's why I told you to extend the downwind' The airport went from quiet to extremely busy in a very short period of time. I am not sure if the controller did not know of Aircraft Y's position or if I misinterpreted my instructions but if the latter I did repeat everything and I believe the controller acknowledged same. I was expecting Aircraft Y to be inside my position and not outside my position. My attention was focused towards the airport with only occasional glances to my left. I was asked once again to extend the downwind and continued the downwind to fall in behind a PC-12 on final; the rest of the flight was uneventful. I don't know how the pilot of Aircraft Y could have missed me; I was right in front of him. My only explanation is that he may have been looking to his right for me; thinking I was more abeam the tower area on the right downwind.,pa28 pilot a right dowinwind report a nmac pattern mvi aircraft cross a right base . tower did not advis either pilot impend conflict .

567,7000,7,Descending through 7000 feet on the Quabn3 RNAV arrival an object passed by the left side; above and within approximately 50 feet of our aircraft. The ACM and I both saw it for only a second or less. The object was football shaped; red and blue in color.

568,800,2,At 800 feet over Boston Harbor while on a visual approach to Runway 04R at BOS; what at first glance seemed to be a large white bird caught my attention at our 3-3:30 position; some 200 feet-400 feet below our altitude; and an estimated 100-200 yards to our right. I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed the 'bird' over land; but it stood out against the deep blue-green of the harbor. And its wings weren't flapping. Oops. I then quickly recognized the familiar shape of a toy; it was a DJI Phantom drone. Because it was well beneath us; no avoidance maneuvering was necessary; but I called out its position to the Captain Pilot Flying (PF) and then to BOS Tower; who quickly relayed the alert to traffic following us on the approach; and who; after we landed; asked me to phone the Tower Supervisor with details; which I did. Although no maneuvering was necessary; the sighting and relaying of the drone's location clearly distracted from my other duties during one of the most critical phases of flight. I've spoken with several other Pilots who know friends and neighbors with drones; or who have purchased one for themselves or their children. I would hope they all realize that the very dense and heavy nature of the batteries on these machines are going to cause far greater damage than a bird of equivalent weight; when one finally; and it seems inevitably; impacts a windscreen; jet engine; or flap assembly. It's going to be ugly; and we really need to spread the word. So I would urge anyone reading this who operate drones; to ask them to visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org and make sure they fully understand where and when drones are appropriate. Because of its altitude; I wouldn't be surprised if the one we saw had been launched in complete innocence off a boat in the harbor; simply to take photos or videos of the boat's owners.It may to be one of the most harmless drone/aircraft encounters on record; yet it was still; if for no other reason than the distraction; a hazard to air navigation.,b737 first offic report a drone 800 feet agl dure approach runway 4R bo . drone wa 200 400 feet below right b737 no evas action wa necessari .

569,2900,10,I was climbing during a straight-out departure from runway 29 at Bridgeport Airport. I was at 2900 feet MSL; heading 290 degrees. I looked out my left window during a scan for traffic; and saw a Learjet at about 150 feet away; at my altitude; also heading in a westerly direction; in a slight left bank.I am quite certain this Learjet had also just departed Bridgeport soon after I had; because I remember seeing the aircraft on the ground at Bridgeport waiting for takeoff clearance as I was taking off. I assume; but do not know for certain; that the Lear had also requested a straight-out departure from runway 29; and had overtaken me because of his higher speed. I assume the Lear pilot may have seen me and therefore was banking left to avoid my aircraft; but I also don't know if that is true. It may have been luck that he had banked when he did; or I believe his aircraft may have collided with mine.I believe the only way to have avoided this near-miss was for the tower not to have allowed the Lear to perform a straight-out departure so soon after a slower aircraft (my aircraft) had departed on a straight-out departure. Again; I do not know for sure if the Learjet had made a straight-out departure; or if he had come so close behind me during maneuvers after some other type of departure. All I know for sure is he came from behind and was very close when I finally saw him on my left.,pa28 pilot report nmac a learjet departur bdr .

570,2200,6,We were setup on the ILS 27 approach into BOS. They were also landing 33L. The Final Approach controller issued us maintain 170 kts to RIPIT (FAF) during the approach we received Red X's 3 times which would indicate the Localizer isn't working on our instruments. This happened outside the FAF and we were visual and could maintain a visual with the airport that we decided that we wouldn't go around because it was VMC. We continued the Approach. Final asked what speed we were doing. I replied 170 kts. He then came back and said spacing wouldn't work and even if we slowed it wouldn't work. Cancel Approach clearance turn right 360 and maintain 2000 and that he would sequence us back. My Captain then replied over the radio 'Unable we were given red x's and we are having navigational problems.' After a few seconds the Captain then said 'we broke out we need to continue the approach' (we were already visual). Final says traffic to look out for 11 o'clock 800 ft. Captain replies traffic insight. Final says maintain a visual with the traffic cleared ILS 27. I then repeat back maintain visual and clear for the approach. Final asks if we were having issues with navigation. I reply we are visual with the airport. Final hands us off to tower. This whole exchange lasted for over 30 seconds from when he asked how fast we were going until we got the hand off to tower. We were 3.6 DME from the ILS when the other aircraft landed. The red X's appeared around 13.5 to 11.5 DME. Upon taxiing in ground had a number for the captain to call. The captain called the number and then after some time referred the guy to our chief pilot I wasn't able to hear what the whole conversation entailed I just heard what the Captain said to the person.,carrier first offic report navig problem aros final bo runway 27 they continu a visual land after atc cancel their approach clearanc due traffic runway 33l .
