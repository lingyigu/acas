ONE ACFT VECTORED FOR ILS 4R; THE OTHER VECTORED FOR VISUAL APCH TO 4L. CLOUD LAYER MOVED IN. THE SEVERITY OF THE CLOUD LAYER WAS NOT MADE CLEAR. ATC WAS MISTAKEN AS TO THE VMA IN THE AREA AND DSNDED ACFT ON VISUAL APCH TO WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS MVA IN ORDER TO GET BELOW CLOUDS. THE SEP BTWN ACFT ON VISUAL APCH AND ACFT ON ILS APCH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY LOST. THIS INFO CAME TO LIGHT AFTER NTAP. IN THE CTLR'S JUDGEMENT; SEP WAS NOT LOST. SEP WAS ALSO LOST BTWN THE ACFT ON VISUAL APCH ON AND TERRAIN. THE SOLUTION TO THE PROB IS TO MAKE CTLRS MORE AWARE OF WX AND HOW QUICKLY AND SEVERELY IT CAN MOVE IN. ADDITIONALLY; THE ACFT ON VISUAL APCH NEVER MADE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THE CLOUDS; WHICH LED THE CTLR TO BELIEVE THE CLOUDS WERE JUST A SCATTERED LAYER AND NOT A FACTOR TO A GOOD; SAFE VISUAL APCH. THE PLT WAS AWARE THAT HE WAS ON VECTORS FOR THE VISUAL APCH. ALSO; TRNING SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CTLRS TO REFRESH MEMORIES ABOUT MVA'S; AS SOMETIMES WE TEND TO DO THINGS BY ROTE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: RPTR CTLR WAS VECTORING AN ACR MLG FOR A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 4L AND; THINKING THE MVA WAS 1500' WITH A SCATTERED CLOUD LAYER AT 2000'; DSNDED THE MLG TO 1500' IN AN AREA OF 1800 MVA. THAT WAS ERROR #1. THEN; AS THE MLG APCHED THE FINAL APCH COURSE FOR RWY 4L AND THE ACR LGT ON ILS RWY 4R; STILL NOT IN THE CLOUDS; RADAR SEP WAS LOST BETWEEN THE TWO WHEN THE MLG ENTERED MORE CLOUDS AND LOST SIGHT OF THE LGT. THIS SYSTEM ERROR OCCURRED MAINLY BECAUSE THE CTLR CONTINUED TO TRY TO CONDUCT VISUAL APCHS AFTER THE WX HAD DETERIORATED TO THE POINT THAT VISUAL APCHS COULD NOT WORK.,,,,ACR-MLG BEING VECTORED FOR VISUAL APCH WAS DESCENDED BELOW MVA AND INTO CONFLICT WITH ACR-LGT ON ILS APCH.92966,198808,1801-2400,GDM,MA,111,54,,5500,Mixed,10,,Night,,,TRACON BOS,Air Carrier,Medium Large Transport; Low Wing; 2 Turbojet Eng,,2,,IFR,Passenger,,Cruise; Initial Approach,STAR STAR,Class E BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air Carrier,Large Transport; Low Wing; 3 Turbojet Eng,,3,,IFR,Cargo / Freight,,Cruise,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air Carrier,Pilot Flying; Captain,Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP); Flight Crew Commercial,Flight Crew Last 90 Days 240; Flight Crew Total 24000; Flight Crew Type 9100,,,,92966,,,Air Carrier,First Officer,Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Commercial,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,Horizontal 0; Vertical 500,,Person Flight Crew; Person Air Traffic Control,,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action; General None Reported / Taken,,Human Factors,ON THE GARDNER 2 ARR TO BOS FLYING THE 111 DEG R LEVEL AT 6000' NOTICED LIGHTS OF AN ACFT FLYING APPROX SW DIRECTION.

THE SECTOR WAS NOT COMBINED WITH ANY OTHER AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS WAS STAFFED; HOWEVER THE RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR WAS DIVIDING HIS ATTN BTWN THE ALBANY SECTOR AND THE SYRACUSE SECTOR (23) WHICH HAD NO RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR AT THE TIME. I HAD BEEN WORKING THE POS FOR 1 HR AND 52 MINS WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. RECOGNIZING THE SIGNS OF MENTAL FATIGUE; I HAD ADVISED THE AREA SUPVR THAT I WAS APCHING 2 HRS ON POS ABOUT 5 MINS BEFORE THE INCIDENT. ALTHOUGH NO OJT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE TIME; A FULL PERFORMANCE LEVEL CTLR WAS TRNING A DEVELOPMENTAL AT THE DELANCEY SECTOR (24) RADAR ASSOCIATE POS EARLIER IN THE PERIOD. ACR X; THE ACFT DESCRIBED ABOVE; HAD DEPARTED BDL ENRTE TO PIT. IT WAS PROCEEDING DIRECT CTR DIRECT HNK. SMT Y WAS EBND AT FL210; PROCEEDING DIRECT GDM TO LAND AT BVY. THIS ACFT; BY LCL PROC; HAD TO LEAVE MY AIRSPACE AT FL180. AFTER INITIALLY BECOMING AWARE OF ACR X; I DIVERTED MY ATTN TO SEEING THAT THE POINT-OUT AND HDOF COORD FOR 3 SUCCESSIVE ALB DEPS PROCEEDING NW HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. THESE ACFT ALSO HAD TO BE SEPARATED FROM AN ACFT NE BOUND AT FL210; AND NEEDING DSCNT TO LAND AT RUT. ACR X CHKED IN ON THE FREQ LEVEL AT 17000'. I CHKED HIS POS AND DIRECTION OF FLT; AND ENVISIONED A ROUTE CTR DIRECT CAM. WITH NO TFC ON THAT TRACK; I ISSUED CLRNC TO CLB AND MAINTAIN FL230 AND INITIATED A COMPUTER HDOF TO THE CAM SECTOR (39). SHORTLY THEREAFTER; I ISSUED CLRNC FOR SMT Y TO DSND AND MAINTAIN FL180. I THEN RETURNED MY ATTN TO THE ALB DEPS AND THE RUT INBND. AN INTERPHONE CALL DIRECTED MY ATTN TO THE NE QUADRANT OF MY SECTOR TO COORDINATE A PLT REQUEST FOR AN ACFT THEN AT FL240 ABOVE MY AIRSPACE. AN ADDITIONAL INTERPHONE CALL DIRECTED MY ATTN TO THAT QUADRANT TO APPROVE A REQUEST FOR CTL FOR ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS LEAVING MY AREA. I THEN RECEIVED AN INTERPHONE CALL FROM THE CAM SECTOR REQUESTING THAT I HDOF ACR X TO SECTOR 38. I THEN LOOKED BACK TO ACR X IN THE SE CORNER OF MY SECTOR AND OBSERVED C/A WITH SMT Y. I ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH ACFT TO TURN RIGHT. ACR X ACKNOWLEDGED AND BLOCKED THE PORTION OF MY XMISSION ADDRESSED TO SMT Y. A LOSS OF REQUIRED SEPARATION SUBSEQUENTLY OCCURRED.

BECAUSE OF ACR Y (A BOS DEP OFF RWY 22R) NOT TAGGING UP ON THE BRITE RADAR AND 2 SEPARATE CTLRS WORKING 2 RWYS SEPARATED BY LESS THAN 1500' (CONSIDERED 1 RWY); THESE NEW PROCS IMPLEMENTED AT BOS TWR IN 3/90 CHANGE FORM HAVING 1 LCL CTLR AND 1 LCL MONITOR TO 2 LCL CTLRS. THIS HAPPENING MADE THE NEW PROCS AT BOS TWR VERY UNSAFE. I THINK THESE NEW PROCS OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT A LOT CLOSER.

ACR Y WAS DEPARTING RWY 22R AT BOS; ASSIGNED A 250 DEG HDG. LCL CTL WAS WORKING BOTH THESE ACFT. ACR Y WAS CLBING TO 3000'. THE LCL CTLR HAD FREQ CHANGE ACR Y TO MY FREQ. REALIZING HER MISTAKE SHE OVERRODE MY POS AT THE SAME TIME ACR Y WAS CHKING IN ON THE FREQ. THE LCL CTLR STATED TO TURN ACR Z TO A 220 DEG OR 180 DEG HDG. I STATED I DID NOT HAVE AN ACR Z ON MY FREQ. SHE RESTATED ACR Y. DURING THIS I DID NOT HEAR ACR Y CHK IN ON THE FREQ. I BEGAN TO SCAN THE RADAR SCOPE AND I HEAD AN ACR NW OF BOS AT 4000'. CHKING THE DEP SCREEN I SAW THE DEP STRIP ON ACR Y. IN THE CONFUSION I ISSUED A TURN TO WRONG ACFT AND TFC. THEN RESTATED IT FOR ACR Y. ACR Y RPTED THE HELI IN SIGHT AND WAS ISSUED A 250 DEG HDG. HE WAS ALREADY BY THE TFC. THE LCL CTLR DID NOT REALIZE THAT CPR X WAS ON AN IFR FLT PLAN.,,,,CPR X HAD LESS THAN STANDARD SEPARATION FROM ACR Y.

AS I MONITORED THE DSNT AND CLB OF BOTH ACFT I REALIZED THAT SEP WAS GOING TO BE LOST. I TOLD ACR X TO EXPEDITE TO FL150; ACR X RPTED OUT OF FL130 APPROX 6 MI E OF MLT Y. ALTHOUGH SEP WAS NOT LOST; I FAILED TO INSURE SEP BY USING A XING RESTRICTION THAT I ASSUMED WOULD HAVE ACR X BELOW MLT Y. I BELIEVE THE ACR X (TFC WAS OBSERVED) HAD TURNED HIS ACFT AS WELL AS DSNDED TO AVOID MLT Y. THE ACTION I TOOK INITIALLY WHEN CONFLICT ALERT ACTIVATED; I FEEL WAS CORRECT; HOWEVER; THE XING RESTRICTION USED WAS NO GOOD. OTHER TFC PREVENT THE USE OF VECTORS ON EITHER ACFT.

PIC REQUESTED AND RECEIVED AN IFR CLRNC FROM BOSTON CTR TO OPERATE AS REQUESTED IN A BLOCK ALT FROM FL390 TO FL410. AS FLT PROCEEDED OFFSHORE AT FL400; BOSTON CTR ADVISED THAT NEW YORK CTR WOULD REQUIRE FL410 DUE TO TFC. AFTER CONCURRENCE WITH SHIP RADAR OPERATOR THAT 1000' INCREASE WOULD NOT DEGRADE TESTS; PIC ACCEPTED FL410. BOSTON CTR THEN HANDED FLT OFF TO NEW YORK WITH COMS THROUGH COMMERCIAL RADIO ON 129.9. AS FLT APCHED DESIGNATED TURN POINT; I RECOGNIZED THAT EVEN THOUGH NEARLY FULL AVAILABLE PWR WAS BEING UTILIZED; INDICATED AIRSPD WAS DECREASING AT A VERY SLOW RATE. I ADVISED COPLT (PF) TO MAKE THE TURN AT A VERY SLOW RATE. AS I PREPARTED TO ASK FOR LOWER ALT AND MAKE A POS RPT; I BECAME SOMEWHAT DISTR AND CP SELECTED HDG MODE ON FLT DIRECTOR. THE AUTOPLT PLACED ACFT IN A 28 DEG BANK. AIRSPD DECREASED FURTHER AND AT AN ALARMING RATE. I DIRECTED CP TO LEVEL WINGS BUT PRE STALL BUFFET WAS FELT BY THE ENTIRE CREW. PF ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN FL410 BUT IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT A STALL WOULD SOON OCCUR. I THEN DIRECTED A SLOW DSNT AND ADVISED COMMERCIAL RADIO  OF PROB. NY CTR CAME UP ON COMMERCIAL RADIO FREQ AND ADVISED ME TO STAY AT FL410 DUE TO TFC. I ADVISED NY CTR THAT I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ALT DUE TO IMPENDING STALL. THE ACFT CONTINUED DSNT AT 500-1000 FT/MIN AND LEVELED OFF AT 38500' MSL. DURING DSNT; I TURNED ON ALL LNDG LIGHTS AND DIRECTED ALL CREW MEMBERS TO MAINTAIN INCREASED WATCH FOR TFC. NONE WAS SIGHTED DESPITE UNLIMITED VISIBILITY. NY CTR ADVISED LAT/LONG POS OF TWO CONFLICTING HVY JETS AT FL370 AND 390 RESPECTIVELY THEN DIRECTED US TO MAINTAIN FL380. THIS ALLOWED US TO INCREASE AIRSPD AS WE WERE HANDED OFF TO BOSTON CTR. BOSTON THEN ASSIGNED FL390 FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FLT. I WAS CLRLY IN ERROR BY ACCEPTING FL410.

I THOUGHT THAT I COULD GENTLY TURN BACK TOWARD THE SHIP; BE HANDED OFF TO BOSTON; RE-ESTABLISH RADAR CONTACT AND DSND BEFORE THE SITUATION GOT 'OUT OF CTL'. CLRLY; I ALLOWED MY DESIRES TO ACCOMPLISH THE RADAR TESTS TO OVERSHADOW GOOD COMMON SENSE. WHO WAS I ALLOWING TO BE THE PIC? THE SHIPS RADAR OPERATOR? THE MY CTLR? I SHOULD HAVE MONITORED THE CP'S ACTIONS MORE CLOSELY ALTHOUGH I IN NO WAY BLAME HIM FOR THE PROBS.

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

AT THIS POINT WE OBSERVED ACR Y ACFT AT OUR 2 O'CLOCK POS; ABOUT 1000 FT BELOW; BANKING R. A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE CTLR QUESTIONED ME REGARDING OUR CLRNC TO FL280 AND INFERRED THE ERROR WAS OURS.

APPROX 45 SECONDS AFTER FLYING THROUGH THE LOC OF 350 DEG HDG ATC ASKED US IF WE WERE INTERCEPTING THE LOC. I REPLIED 'NO SIR'.

IN SPITE OF THE INFO; HE WENT AHEAD AND COMPLIED WITH THE ADVISORY. MY CONCERN IS THAT UNDER SOME CONDITIONS; I; AS A CTLR; WOULD USE MIN SEPARATION TO EXPEDITE TFC OR TO EFFECT A SMOOTH ORDERLY FLOW. IF TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT ARE GOING TO DEVIATE EVEN IF THEY KNOW THE TFC IS GOING TO BE KEPT OUT OF THEIR WAY THEN IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE CONFLICT; ESPECIALLY IN THE TERMINAL ENVIRONMENT. ANOTHER TCASII SITUATION OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS WHEN A TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT DID NOT WANT TO TAKE A TURN TO THE R BECAUSE HE SAW A TARGET ON TCASII BUT IT DIDN'T HAVE AN ALT ENCODER. THERE WAS NOT ANYBODY ON MY RADAR WITHIN 7 MI OF HIM; AND THE HDG THAT I WANTED HIM TO FLY DID NOT PUT HIM IN CONFLICT WITH ANYBODY. HIS SECOND GUESSING CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT THERE WASN'T ANY TFC TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. BY THE TIME ALL WAS SAID AND DONE; I WAS BEHIND WITH THE REST OF MY TFC. NOT A GOOD SITUATION.

THE THINGS WHICH I THINK CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PROBLEM WAS: 1) I WAS USED TO THE CTLR TELLING ME TO CALL HIM WHEN AIRBORNE; AND USED THIS PROC EVEN WHEN THE CTLR DIDN'T SPECIFY IT. 2) THE CTLR (OR FAA) EXPECTS THE PLT TO CALL FROM THE GND WHEN THEY KNOW VERY WELL THAT THERE IS NO RADIO COVERAGE ON THE GND AT THAT HELIPAD. IF THEY WANT PLTS TO CALL BEFORE AIRBORNE; THEY SHOULD REMOTE A TRANSCEIVER CAPABLE OF COVERAGE IN THAT AREA. IN THE FUTURE; IF I CAN'T RAISE THE CTLR BEFORE 100 FT; I'LL RETURN TO THE HELIPAD AND TRY AGAIN; RATHER THAN CONTINUE FLT WITHOUT A CLRNC. MEANWHILE; I SUGGEST THAT THE FAA STANDARDIZE PROC FOR DEALING WITH THIS HELIPAD SO THAT MISUNDERSTANDINGS LIKE THIS DON'T OCCUR.,,,,HELI TOOK OFF FROM DOWNTOWN HELI PAD.

AS I WAS DOING THE POST TKOF CLBOUT CHKLIST; I SPOTTED A LOW WING RADIAL ENG SINGLE (WARBIRD?) HEAD-ON AT A CONVERGING ALT. HE WAS APPARENTLY SOMEWHAT OVERSHOOTING AN ENTRY TO THE R DOWNWIND PATTERN (PUBLISHED PATTERN ALT IS 1933 FT); TO FOLLOW THE SMA THAT HAD DEPARTED 2 AHEAD OF ME. I HAD TO DIVE SOMEWHAT AND ALTER COURSE CLOSER TO THE 'STRAIGHT OUT' SMA. TWR HAD NOT ADVISED ME OF THE CONFLICTING TFC. I BELIEVE THE LOW WING SINGLE OVERSHOT HIS ENTRY; POSSIBLY DISTR BY TRYING TO MAKE PROPER SEQUENCING ON THE SMA TURNING DOWNWIND. MORE IMPORTANT; THE TWR CTLR SHOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD BOTH HAVE A LONG LINE OF VFR TFC ON A 1933 FT R DOWNWIND; AND HAVE ME DO A R DEP WITH A CLB TO 2000 FT. ONE ADDITIONAL UNUSUAL OPERATING FACTOR AT BED SOMEWHAT INCREASED THE CHANCE FOR A CONFLICT. AS AN IFR; I WAS TOLD TO KEEP ON GND FREQ UNTIL I HAD COMPLETED ALL MY PRETKOF CHKS.

TFC HAD BUILT IN THE HFD VICINITY WHICH THE RADAR TRAINEE WAS SATISFACTORILY HANDLING. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM CTR SECTOR ON A POINT OUT ON AN ACR ORH DEP CLBING TO 160 DIRECT CTR. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE APPROVED THE POINT OUT.

I KNEW THAT IF I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION NOW; I WOULD DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO CLR THE TFC. I TOOK CTLS FROM THE PF; TURNED 45 DEG TO MY R AND DSNDED QUICKLY TO APPROX 5700 FT WHEN I SAW THE JET BEHIND ME AND WELL ABOVE. I THEN RETURNED TO 6500 FT AND ON COURSE AND BEFORE I COULD INFORM ATC OF MY EVASIVE ACTION I WAS QUERIED BY ATC. ATC THEN TOLD ME THE JET WAS LEVEL AT 6000 AND THAT MY EVASIVE ACTION BROUGHT ME CLOSER TO HIS ALT. THE PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED BY ADHERENCE TO THE SEE AND AVOID CONCEPT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ATC'S FAILURE TO INFORM ME OF CONVERGING PATH TFC. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS 500 FT VERT SEPARATION IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM THE JET WAS BELOW ME; AND NOT CLBING. HUMAN PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS: PERCEPTIONS: 500 FT SEPARATION IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WITH CONFIDENCE NECESSARY TO ENSURE COLLISION AVOIDANCE. JUDGEMENTS: I JUDGED THE JET TO BE EITHER AT MY ALT; OR CLBING SINCE IT JUST DEPARTED BOSTON (OR IT APPEARED TO BE DEPARTING BOSTON). DECISIONS: I HAD NO TIME TO FURTHER ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE ALT CONVERGENCE NOR TO QUERY ATC ABOUT THE AIRLINER. SO I DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION THAT SHOULD ENSURE AVOIDANCE; RATHER THAN GAMBLE THAT THE JET WAS LOWER THAN ME. ACTIONS/INACTIONS: IF I WAS INFORMED BY ATC AS TO THE JET'S ALT; I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT OUR SEPARATION; AND MAYBE EVASIVE ACTION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NECESSARY.

OUR DEP INSTRUCTIONS WERE AN INITIAL CLB TO 3000 FT WITH A R TURN AFTER TKOF TO 300 DEGS. AFTER CONTACTING DEP CTL; WE WERE CLRED TO 4000 FT ON THE SAME HDG. ATC THEN ISSUED A TA FOR VFR TFC AT 11 O'CLOCK 2-3 MI AT 3500 FT CIRCLING. AT ALMOST THE SAME INSTANT WE GOT A TCASII TA FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY 'MONITOR VERT SPD' FOLLOWED BY A TCASII RA -- CLB. ATC AT THE SAME TIME WAS GIVING US A R TURN TO 360 DEGS; MAINTAIN 4000 FT; DIRECT MANCHESTER MHT WHEN ABLE. I DID NOT HAVE THE TFC IN SIGHT AND FOLLOWED THE TCASII CLB RA. THE RESULT OF THE TCASII CLB CREATED ANOTHER TA FROM APCHING 5000 FT TFC. ATC DETERMINED THAT THE 5000 FT TFC HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH US AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED OUR CLB TO 5000 FT AND THEN A FURTHER CLB TO 12000 FT. THE INITIAL CONFLICT WAS CAUSED BY THE 3500 FT VFR TFC CIRCLING BELOW US; AS PER THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM; AS WE WERE CLBING TO 4000 FT. THE RA CAUSED ME TO CLB THROUGH 4000 FT CREATING A POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH 5000 FT TFC.

BOS CTR NEVER STOPPED OUR DSCNT NOR DID THEY STOP THE OTHER ACFT'S CLB. WE REALIZED A POTENTIAL PROBLEM FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN TCASII ISSUED AN RA. TCASII SAID 'REDUCE YOUR DSCNT' AND SO I DID. I REDUCED THE DSCNT TO 0 FPM AS WE LEVELED AT 14300 AND THAT IS WHEN THE ACFT PASSED ABEAM ON OUR PORT SIDE. WE HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT DURING THE ENTIRE EPISODE; BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE JUST WHERE HE WAS IN RELATION TO OUR POS. AFTER PASSING; WE QUESTIONED BOS AS TO HIS POS AND ALT. THE RESPONSE WAS DEFENSIVE AND THE CTLR STATED THAT HE TOLD US WE COULD LEVEL AT 15000 UNTIL TFC PASSED IF WE WISHED TO! NO ONE IN MY CREW HEARD THAT XMISSION. THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE VFR TFC SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FLY AGAINST GARDENER-2 ARR TFC AND CLBING THROUGH OUR DSCNT ALT. AVOIDANCE TURNS COULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED; ALT CHANGES COULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED. MORE AND BETTER COM COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO MAKE EACH OF US MORE FULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 209780: AT 16000 FT AND 5 MI W OF GARDNER; THE CAPT PULLED OUT THE SPDBRAKES TO INCREASE OUR RATE OF DSCNT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE XING RESTRICTION. AT SOME POINT; I HEARD THE CTLR SAY SOMETHING ABOUT '15000;' BUT DID NOT CATCH THE WHOLE XMISSION AND ASSUMED THAT HE WAS TELLING US THAT THE TFC WAS AT 15000 FT. OUR FO DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALL. I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC MIGHT BE GETTING CLOSE TO US SO I KEPT MY EYE ON HIM. AT APPROX 15000 FT OUR TCASII GAVE US A VERBAL RA OF 'REDUCE DSCNT; REDUCE DSCNT.' THIS CERTAINLY CAUGHT MY ATTN SO I GLANCED AT THE TCASII INST WHICH SHOWED A RED ARC ON THE LOWER HALF OF THE CASE. I DID NOT FOCUS MY EYES ON THE INST BECAUSE I WANTED TO CLR FOR THE TFC. THE CAPT STARTED TO STOP OUR DSCNT AT THIS POINT. AT APPROX 14500 FT I SAW THE TFC PASS OFF OUR L WING WITHIN 1/4 MI AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE SAME ALT. BEING THAT IT WAS NIGHT; I CAN ONLY GUESS AT THE HORIZ DISTANCE. OUR CAPT HAD NOT MADE ANY EVASIVE TURN; AND I NOTICED THAT OUR ALT BOTTOMED OUT AT 14300 FT AS WE PASSED OVER GARDNER VOR. THE CTLR NEVER ISSUED US ANY TURNS OR ALT CHANGES. THE VFR TFC DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONFLICT. A FEW MI LATER; OUR FO TOLD THE CTR THAT WE HAD SEEN THE TFC PASS US AND ASKED WHAT ALT HE WAS AT. THE CTLR SAID HE WAS AT 14500 FT. AT THIS POINT; THE VFR TFC SAID HE THOUGH WE WERE TOLD THAT 'IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE MAINTAIN 15000 FT.' THE CTLR SAID NOTHING. MY AIRPLANE'S CREW MEMBERS NEVER HEARD THE 'SUGGESTION' AND CERTAINLY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY SUCH XMISSION AT THE TIME. IN MY MIND; THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION; I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC WAS MAINTAINING 15000 FT AND THAT WE WOULD BE DSNDING WELL IN FRONT OF HIM. I FEEL THAT THE ATC CTLR'S LACK OF AGGRESSIVENESS; FAILURE TO CTL HIS AIRSPACE; AND OVERALL NONCHALANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TFC CONFLICT.

THE SMT Y ROTATED ABOUT 5 SECONDS LATER; APPROX 6000 FT AWAY AND THE TWR IMMEDIATELY CLRED US AGAIN TO CROSS 22R. I KNEW THAT WE HAD CLRNC TO CROSS; AND THAT THE FO HAD READ IT BACK TO THE TWR. I WAS SHOCKED THAT BOS TWR HAD CLRED THE COMMUTER TO TKOF BEFORE WE WERE ACROSS THE ACTIVE. I THINK IT WAS AN 'ERROR' ON THEIR PART AS I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S LEGAL TO HAVE AIRPLANES XING THE DEP END OF THE RWY WHILE OTHERS ARE ON TKOF. NOTHING ELSE WAS SAID ON RADIO. AFTER PARKING AT BOS; I WENT DOWN TO OPS AND CALLED THE TWR TO CLR ANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS. I TALKED TO A SUPVR WHO TOLD ME ANOTHER SUPVR WAS WORKING THE TWR POS AND THAT AS HE HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT; IT WAS PROBABLY NO BIG DEAL. I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO FILE A NASA RPT JUST IN CASE SOMEBODY ELSE THINKS IT IS A BIG DEAL. I'M A 10 MONTH CAPT OF THIS ACFT (LGT); VERY CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS AND AM SURPRISED BY THE BOS TWR'S CASUAL ATTITUDE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT.,,,,COMMUTER ACFT WAS CLRED FOR TKOF AND ROLLING WHILE AN ACR WAS XING RWY.217369,199208,1801-2400,BOS,MA,,0,0,,VMC,,,Night,,,Tower BOS,Air Carrier,Widebody; Low Wing; 3 Turbojet Eng,,3,,IFR,Passenger,,Landing; Initial Approach,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air Carrier,Light Transport; Low Wing; 2 Turboprop Eng,,,,None,Other Other,,Taxi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Air Carrier,Captain,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),Flight Crew Last 90 Days 225; Flight Crew Total 16363; Flight Crew Type 225,,,,217369,,,Air Carrier,First Officer; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict NMAC; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Horizontal 0; Vertical 100,,Person Flight Crew,,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action; Flight Crew Executed Go Around / Missed Approach,,Human Factors,ACR X LNDG AT NIGHT IN VMC CONDITIONS; MAKING A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 33L AT BOSTON LOGAN WITH ILS ASSIST.

THEY TRIED TO SELL US ON RWY 15R BUT THAT MEANT A TAILWIND SO WE INSISTED ON RWY 33L AND WAS ASSIGNED IT AND VECTORED TO FINAL FOR IT. STARTING DOWN FINAL AND AFTER CONTACTING TWR AND BEING CLRED FOR LNDG; I NOTICED A RED LIGHT BLINKING ON THE END OF THE RWY. IT WAS HARD TO TELL BUT IT LOOKED OUT OF PLACE COMPARED TO THE OTHER RED LIGHTS OF THE RWY. WE ASKED THE TWR BUT GOT NO REPLY AS HE WAS BUSY WITH OTHER TFC. WE IN THE COCKPIT COULDN'T DETERMINE WHAT IT WAS SO ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE GLIDE SLOPE WE ASKED TWR AGAIN WHAT THE LIGHT WAS; BUT NO ANSWER. AT ABOUT 150 FT; OR SO; OUR LNDG LIGHTS SHOWED THE OUTLINE OF AN AIRPLANE ON THE END OF THE RWY. WE MADE A MISSED APCH; TOLD THE TWR WHAT WE SAW AND THEN WAS VECTORED AROUND AGAIN FOR AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG ON RWY 33L. AFTER LNDG WE TALKED TO THE TWR AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS ONE OF OUR COMPANY LTT'S ON THE RWY OPERATED BY MAINT PEOPLE. IF HE WAS CLRED TO BE THERE THE TWR FORGOT TO TELL US. THE ONLY LIGHT WE COULD SEE WAS A RED BEACON WHICH ALMOST BLENDED INTO THE RWY END LIGHTS. IT WAS VERY UNNERVING TO FIND A PLANE THERE.

AS COULD BE EXPECTED THE VFR TFC WAS HVY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL HOLIDAY. COMBINE THIS WITH THE COMPLICATED AIRSPACE AROUND THE TCA AT RELIEVER ARPTS INCREASES THE CHANCE OF A CONFLICT MANY FOLD. OFF HAND; I CAN THINK OF 2 POTENTIAL DANGEROUS INCIDENTS INVOLVING MY ACFT ON THIS FLT. THEY ARE: A POSSIBLE NEAR MISS IN THE TFC PATTERN. ON DEP FROM RWY 27; I WAS CLRED FOR A R DEP TO CROSS MIDFIELD ABOVE 1600 FT MSL. AT THE TIME OF THIS CLRNC; I WAS LOOKING INTO THE SUN WHILE SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS LNDG RWY 9. SO; WHEN I GLANCED AT THE ALTIMETER; I MISTAKENLY READ 1600 FT INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL 600 FT. THUS; I CHKED OUT OF 1600 MSL AND STARTED THE TURN FOR THE R DOWNWIND DEP. I DIDN'T SEE THE ACFT THAT RPTED THE CONFLICT. INSTEAD; I HEARD THE RADIO XMISSION TO TWR AND REALIZED THE MISTAKE. MY ACFT CROSSED THE RWY 16 PATTERN RIGHT AT PATTERN ALT DURING THE CLB. NOT GOOD! GENERAL THOUGHTS: 1) FLYING A LIGHT SINGLE CAN BE AS DEMEANING AS A TURBOJET. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN 'DOWNGRADING' TO A MORE BASIC ACFT; ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT FLYING ONE FOR A WHILE DUE TO BEING IN A LARGER ACFT. IT IS VERY EASY TO BECOME LOCKED INTO 'PROCS OF A 2-MAN CREW; OR WORSE YET; DEVELOP A 'COCKY' ATTITUDE FLYING THE TURBINE EQUIP. 2) AVOID EXPECTANCY! (I.E.; READING AN ALTIMETER WRONG). IT IS EASY IN A STRESSFUL SIT FOR THE MIND TO SEE WHAT IT IS EXPECTING TO SEE. THUS; WHEN A PERSON USUALLY FLIES ON ACFT CLBING AT 4000-7000 FPM; IT IS EASY TO THINK OF CLB IN TERMS OF FPM AS BEING A CONSTANT. THUS; 'I HAVE CLBED FOR 20 SECONDS; SO I SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS ALT' COMES TO MIND. 2 CONTRIBUTING SUB NOTES: A) DIFFERENCES IN ALTIMETERS. THE SMA HAS THE TYPICAL DARK TYPE OF ALTIMETER; WHERE MOST TURBOJET ACFT HAVE THE NUMERICAL READOUT FOR THOUSAND AND HUNDREDS OF FT. B) MY MIND HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED TO BE TURNING AT 1600 FT AS A RESULT OF FLYING THE TEB 2 DEP 4 NIGHTS A WK; WHICH CALLS FOR A TURN AT 1500 FT WHEN DEPARTING RWY 1. 3) CALM CAVU DAYS; ESPECIALLY HOLIDAYS BRING OUT ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS OF PLTS IN ABUNDANCE. THUS; CROSSED AIRSPACE BECOMES MORE CROWDED. READING CHARTS AND ANSWERING PAX QUESTIONS ARE DISTRS FROM LOOKING FOR OTHER ACFT AND FLYING THE ACFT. 4) WKEND VFR IN A LIGHT SINGLE IS HAZARDOUS.

UPON MY RETURN TO MVY A COUPLE OF HRS LATER; SAME CTLR (NOW WORKING GND) ASKED IF I SAW THE TWIN CESSNA. MY REPLY WAS YES AND THAT I TURNED TO AVOID HIM AND THAT HE WAS A REAL 'WINNER.'

AT APPROX XX30Z I WAS WORKING AN HVT FLT EBOUND FROM JFK; THE FLT WAS CLBING TO FL550 B600. I WAS ALSO WORKING A GULSTREAM; G4; FLYING FROM ACK LACKS FLANN A523 TO DEST. WHEN THE ACFT WERE APPROX 100 MI APART I OBSERVED THAT BOTH ACFT WERE AT FL430. I BELIEVED THAT THE ACFT WOULD CROSS IN THE VICINITY OF LACKS INTXN AND THAT I WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ALT SEPARATION. I WAS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL COMPLEX SITS WITH OTHER ACFT. WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THIS SIT I HAD APPROX 60 MI BTWN THE ACFT WITH THE HVT CLBING OUT OF FL440. I ASKED IF THE HVT WOULD BE OUT OF FL450 WITHIN THE NEXT 40 MI. HE SAID 'YES.' AGAIN; I WAS DISTRACTED WITH ANOTHER SIT WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THE CONCORD THE FLT WAS AT FL443 AND APPROX 25 MI FROM THE G4. I AGAIN ASKED THE FLT IF HE WOULD BE OUT OF FL450. AT THIS TIME HE STATED THAT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED A TEMP INVERSION AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CLB. THE HVT PLT WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE TEMP INVERSION AND I WAS UNABLE TO BROADCAST ON THE FREQ TO DSND THE G4. I HAD A HALO ON THE G4 AND IT WAS OBVIOUS NOW THAT THE TARGETS WERE GOING TO MERGE. WHEN THE HVT FINISHED I IMMEDIATELY DSNDED THE G4 AND CALLED TFC TO THE FLT. AS THE HVT ENTERED THE HALO HE WAS SHOWING FL443 I ASKED THE G4 TO CONFIRM OUT OF FL420 AND HE CONCURRED. THE PLT OF THE G4 THEN STATED THAT HE HAD JUST FLOWN THROUGH THE SONIC BOOM OF THE HVT AND THAT IT HAD BEEN A VERY UNPLEASANT SIT TO BE IN. WITH THE SPDS INVOLVED AND THE RATES OF CLB THE RADAR SNITCH DID NOT ACTIVATE. HOWEVER; I BELIEVE THAT THE ACFT PASSED WITHIN 1400 FT OF EACH OTHER. THE HVT WAS ACCELERATING TO MACH 2 AT THE TIME. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER ENCOUNTERED A SIT WHERE THE HVT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE HIS CLB. NORMALLY THE HVT IS OUT OF FL470 AT THE POINT WHERE THESE ACFT PASSED. ALTHOUGH I IDENTED THE SIT EARLY I DID NOT TAKE POSITIVE CTL OF THE SIT TO ENSURE SEPARATION OF THE ACFT. I HAD SEVERAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE FROM STOPPING THE G4 AT A LOWER ALT INITIALLY OR VECTORING THE ACFT TO PLACE THE HVT BEHIND THE G4. ALTHOUGH MY EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN THAT THE HVT WOULD BE CLR OF THE ALT IN SUFFICIENT TIME; THIS WAS NOT THE CASE AND I LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON.,,,,HVT CLB THROUGH OCCUPIED ALT HAD LTSS FROM G4.

AFTER BEING GIVEN A SUBSEQUENT R TURN; WE WERE TURNED FURTHER R TO; I BELIEVE; 210 DEGS. AT THIS POINT TCASII ADVISED 'TFC.' THROUGH A BREAK IN CLOUDS; I OBSERVED ACFT Y CORRESPONDING TO THE TCASII LOCATION (FO WAS FLYING). ATC (NOW APCH CTL AGAIN) GAVE US A TURN TO 120 DEGS. IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER; THE TCASII COMMANDED 'MONITOR VERT SPD;' INDICATING A HIGH RATE OF CLB REQUIRED. CLB WAS IMMEDIATELY INITIATED AND THEN ATC ADVISED US TO 'CLB TO 4000 FT -- CLB NOW!' I ADVISED APCH WE WERE ALREADY CLBING. AT 4000 FT; TCASII ADVISED CLR OF CONFLICT. MOST OF THIS WAS IN CLOUDS. I DID NOT SEE THE OTHER ACFT.

I WAS CONCENTRATING ON ACFT CTL AND MISSED THE CALL; BUT I SAW THE CAPT DIAL IN 6000 FT ON THE ALT ALERTER AND AM POSITIVE I HEARD HIM READ BACK THE ALT ASSIGNMENT AS 6000 FT TO ATC. ATC'S NEXT XMISSION WAS TO ANOTHER ACFT AND THEY DID NOT QUESTION THE READBACK. SHORTLY AFTER LEVELING AT 6000 FT; I HEARD ATC CALL SOMETHING LIKE 'ACFT XX; YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT 5000 FT; 5000 FT ACFT XX.' I REDUCED PWR AND STARTED TO DSND WHEN THE CAPT SAID 'NO STAY HERE.' HE WAS TRYING TO GET CONFIRMATION; AND SINCE THE FREQ WAS VERY BUSY; I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE I MISTOOK A CALL THAT WAS INTENDED FOR ANOTHER ACFT. THE CAPT GOT CONFIRMATION; AND I IMMEDIATELY REDUCED PWR TO IDLE AND CONDUCTED A RAPID DSCNT TO 5000 FT. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A DEP CLBOUT IN VERY BUSY BOSTON AIRSPACE. VECTORS WERE BEING GIVEN AT THE USUAL RAPID RATE TO MANY ACFT. IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT; INSTRUCTIONS GET MISHEARD QUITE FREQUENTLY. THE TECHNIQUE OF READING BACK CLRNCS SHOULD; AND DOES IN MOST CASES; CATCH THESE ERRORS. IN THIS CASE; IT APPARENTLY DID NOT. IN RETROSPECT; I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE RADIO XMISSIONS EVEN THOUGH I WAS CONCENTRATING ON ACFT CTL. IN A LESS HECTIC ENVIRONMENT; AND/OR WITH INCREASED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; I COULD HAVE CAUGHT THE MISTAKE. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 396712: ZBW THEN SAID TO CLB TO 5000 FT. I READ BACK 5000 FT AND BY MISTAKE DIALED 6000 FT INTO THE ALT PRESELECTOR. AFTER CLBING TO 6000 FT ANOTHER ACFT CLBED FROM 6000 FT TO 6700 FT BASED ON A WARNING GENERATED ON THEIR TCASII. THE FO CONFIRMED 6000 FT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR SOPS. AFTER THE INCIDENT I ASKED HIM WHAT HE HEARD AND HE SAID THAT HE REALLY WASN'T PAYING ATTN TO THE RADIO CALLS.

AT 6700 FT DSNDING AT A RATE OF 1000 FPM; WE RECEIVED AN RA ON THE CONFLICTING TFC. THE FIRST COMMAND WAS TO DSND. I BELIEVE THIS WAS DUE TO THE PRESENT DSCNT RATE OF OUR ACFT AND THE HIGH RATE OF CLB OF THE OTHER ACFT. AFTER THE FIRST COMMAND; IT WAS FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO CLB. AT 6400 FT; THE CAPT IMMEDIATELY COMPLIED WITH THE SECOND RA COMMAND. I NOTED AT THIS POINT THE 2 ACFT WERE 500 FT VERTLY AND APPROX 1 MI HORIZLY SEPARATED. AT 6800 FT; THE TCASII INDICATED THAT WE WERE CLR OF CONFLICT. BY MY ESTIMATE THE OTHER ACFT WAS AT 5900 FT AND CLBING WHEN THE RA ADVISED US TO CLB.

AS WE APCHED 6000 FT WHILE CLBING TO 14000 FT WE NOTICED ANOTHER ACFT APCHING FROM R TO L AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSE TO OUR ALT. AT FIRST WE DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS A SMALL ACFT; AN ASSUMPTION THAT SEEMED TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE LACK OF A TCASII RETURN. CONTINUED OBSERVATION STILL PRODUCED NO CONFIRMING TCASII RETURN. BY THE TIME IT BECAME CLR THAT THIS WAS INDEED A SMALL; CLOSE ACFT RATHER THAN A LARGE; DISTANT ACFT; IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE EFFECTIVE EVASIVE ACTION. SINCE THE ACFT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS THE WINDSCREEN DURING THE ENTIRE EVENT WE REALIZED WE WERE NOT ON A COLLISION COURSE; ALTHOUGH HAD WE REALIZED HOW CLOSE THE ACFT WAS AND WOULD BECOME; WE MOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED SOME TYPE OF EVASIVE MANEUVER. THE OTHER ACFT PASSED IN FRONT OF US; WELL WITHIN 1/2 MI HORIZLY AND ABOUT 200-400 FT ABOVE US. WE COULD CLRLY SEE THAT THE ACFT WAS WHITE WITH A BLUE AFT FUSELAGE AND BLUE TRIM ON THE WINGLETS. WE BELIEVED IT TO BE A CANADAIR CHALLENGER. WE ASKED DEP TO TELL US WHO THE ACFT WAS; AND THEY RESPONDED THAT THEY SHOWED NO TFC. A FURTHER QUESTION REVEALED THAT THEY DID HAVE A PRIMARY TARGET ONLY. UPON OUR ARR IN MEMPHIS; I CALLED THE DEP CTL SUPVR. HE RELATED THAT THE ACFT HAD ALSO DEPARTED BOSTON; HAD NOT TURNED ON ITS XPONDER (HENCE; NO TCASII RETURN); AND HAD SOMEHOW LOST RADIO CONTACT. THE CTLR APPARENTLY DID NOT REALIZE THE ACFT WAS THERE (MY ASSUMPTION). WHEN HE TOLD ME THE ACFT WAS A LEARJET I REALIZED WE MAY HAVE COME EVEN CLOSER THAN MY ESTIMATE SINCE WE HAD ASSUMED THE ACFT WAS A 'WDB' CHALLENGER. THIS WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON THE TCASII. WE ARE SO USED TO CONFIRMING TFC BY XCHKING THE TCASII THAT WE TEND TO NOT BELIEVE OUR EYES WHEN WHAT THEY TELL US DIFFERS FROM THE TCASII.

WE HAD VISUAL ON THE TFC AND THEY WERE TURNING AWAY FROM US; SO WE DID NOT CHANGE COURSE. WE WERE ON VECTORS.

I ACKNOWLEDGED '10000 FT AND 118.00.' WE CLBED TO 10000 FT MSL AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT NEW YORK ON 118.00. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO 'CHK IN' BEFORE RECEIVING A RESPONSE FROM ATC. THE CTLR SAID THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON 132.25. I INFORMED THEM THAT WE HAD JUST COME FROM 132.25 BUT THAT WE WOULD GO BACK TO THEM. AT SOME TIME IN THE HDOF CONFUSION AND SWITCHING FREQS; WE NOTED OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC 2.5 MI AWAY ON TCASII AT 10000 FT MSL AND TURNED APPROX 20 DEGS L OF COURSE TO ENSURE SEPARATION. I BELIEVE THE TFC SHOWED AS A 'TA' ON TCASII. THE CAPT AND MYSELF COMMENTED THAT WE WERE SURPRISED THAT ATC HAD NOT POINTED OUT THE CONFLICTING TFC. THIS EVENT OCCURRED BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO RETURN TO 132.25. UPON RETURNING TO 132.25; THE CTLR IMMEDIATELY ASKED US OUR ALT. I STATED 10000 FT. WITH SOME URGENCY IN HIS VOICE HE TOLD US TO RETURN TO 9000 FT; PROBABLY DUE TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC WHICH BY THIS TIME WAS NOT A FACTOR. HE THEN ASKED WHO GAVE US 10000 FT AND THE FREQ CHANGE. I SAID THE PREVIOUS CTLR. BY THIS POINT; SO MUCH CONFUSION EXISTED THAT THE CAPT AND I COULD NOT BE SURE WHICH FREQ WE WERE ACTUALLY ON WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO MAINTAIN 10000 FT. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT REALIZE IT AT THE TIME; THERE WERE SOME ITEMS THAT DID NOT SEEM RIGHT. FIRST; THE FLT PLANNED RTE WAS FOR 9000 FT MSL AND WE WERE NOW AT 10000 FT MSL. SECOND; WE HAD JUST COME FROM 118.00 TO 132.25 SO WHY WOULD WE BE HANDED BACK TO 118.00. IN THAT MOMENT; WE WERE SIMPLY COMPLYING WITH ATC'S INSTRUCTIONS. MY CAPT AND I DISCUSSED THE EVENTS THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED AND WONDERED HOW WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN TO 10000 FT IF ATC ACTUALLY WANTED US AT 9000 FT. I HAD READ BACK THE ALT ASSIGNMENT (ALONG WITH THE FREQ CHANGE) AND SELECTED IT IN THE ALT SELECTOR. AFTER REVIEWING THE SIT; MY ONLY GUESS IS THAT MAYBE I ACKNOWLEDGED AN ALT AND FREQ CHANGE THAT WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO ANOTHER ACFT GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY WE WERE GETTING HANDED BACK TO 118.00 AND GIVEN 10000 FT; ALL POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION FOR A WBOUND ACFT. NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ATC THAT MY READBACK WAS INCORRECT OR THAT THE COMMAND WAS ACTUALLY FOR ANOTHER ACFT WAS RECEIVED; AS FAR AS I KNOW. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CTLR WAS NOT VIGILANT IN LISTENING TO MY READBACK OR THAT I SWITCHED FREQS BEFORE THE CTLR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ME. AS FOR THE REASON THAT ATC DID NOT POINT OUT TFC TO US MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WE WERE 'BTWN' FREQS AS A RESULT OF THE HDOF CONFUSION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE. THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE TCASII SYS DOING ITS INTENDED JOB EVEN THOUGH UNDER POSITIVE ATC IFR CTL. IN THE FUTURE I PLAN TO TREAT ALL ALTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THAT IN MY CLRNC/FLT PLAN WITH SUSPECT.,,,,ACR SF34 FLC APPARENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED DSCNT CLRNC FOR ANOTHER ACFT; AND COMES INTO CONFLICT WITH POSSIBLY ANOTHER ACFT.

TWR CTLR (A NEW VOICE) ASKED IF WE SAW TFC; THEN VECTORED US BEHIND TFC UNTIL PROPER SEPARATION WAS ACHIEVED. WE WERE THEN TURNED OVER TO DEP CTL. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS CONTRIBUTED: 1) 2 TWR FREQS USED FOR RWY 22L AND RWY 22R (OTHER ACFT DEPARTED RWY 22R). 2) RWY 22R WAS BEHIND US AS WE TAXIED INTO POS ON RWY 22L. 3) MY ATTN; AS WE TAXIED INTO POS ON RWY 22L; WAS ON TFC LNDG RWY 27 WHICH CROSSES RWY 22L DOWNFIELD. 4) ROLLING TKOF MAKES IT LESS LIKELY TO BE AWARE OF ALL OTHER MOVEMENT ON AIRFIELD.

THE TCASII CALLED OUT THE TFC AND WE WERE VISUALLY WELL CLR. APPARENTLY HE WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD A VISUAL ON US AND HIS TCASII WAS GIVING HIM A TA OR RA WARNING. HE ASKED CTR FOR OUR CALL SIGN. THE TCASII LAGGED BEHIND US A BIT BECAUSE OF OUR HIGH RATE OF CLB. IN THE FUTURE I WILL HESITATE TO TAKE VISUAL CLBS TAKING TCASII AND ITS WARNINGS INTO CONSIDERATION.

BECAUSE WE STILL HAD IT IN SIGHT; WE TURNED THE TCASII MODE TO 'TA ONLY.' MOMENTS LATER THE TFC SEEMED TO BE CONVERGING WITH US AND LEVEL. I INSTRUCTED MY FO TO BANK L IMMEDIATELY; AS WE SAFELY PASSED THE TFC. AT THE SAME TIME APCH ASKED US TO VERIFY THAT WE STILL HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT. I ACKNOWLEDGED WITH 'AFFIRMATIVE; WE ARE IN A L TURN.' HE REPLIED WITH 'ROGER; PROCEED DIRECT MADISON VOR WHEN ABLE.' WE WERE HANDED OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT. A GOOD LESSON WAS LEARNED IN THAT WHEN MAINTAINING VISUAL SEPARATION; ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT; EXTREME CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED.

BEDFORD'S CLASS D RUNS UP TO 2400 FT; BUT BOSTON APCH SEEMS TO RUN IT AT 2000 FT. THIS MAY BE WHY THE TWR KEEPS THE SPOTTERS DOWN LOW. ACFT IN THE LNDG PHASE OF FLT HAVE RIGHT-OF-WAY.

JUST AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS RPT; I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS A PROB. WE HAD NO WARNING ABOUT ACR AND IT WAS UNNERVING SEEING A PLANE THAT CLOSE WITHOUT ANY WARNING FROM ATC. THE REST OF THE FLT CONTINUED WITHOUT INCIDENT. I FEEL ATC SHOULD HAVE EITHER GAVE US A HDG ON DEP; TOLD US THE OTHER PLANE WAS GOING TO BE THERE; OR STAGGERED THE DEPS SO EITHER ONE OF US WAS AHEAD OF THE OTHER.

UPON INSISTENCE TO USE R DOWNWIND BY THE TWR CTLR; WHO APPEARED UNAWARE OF MY ACTUAL POS; I MADE AN UNINTENDED POOR DECISION TO CROSS IN FRONT OF DEPARTING TFC; ALONG THE UPWIND LEG. DEPARTING TFC; A PIPER WARRIOR; WAS CLOSE BUT NEVER ON A COLLISION COURSE AND WAS FULLY IN SIGHT AT ALL TIMES. THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IS DESCRIBED HERE. AT 9 MI SSW OF HANSCOM FIELD; HDG APPROX 030 DEGS; BOS APCH CTL CEASED RADAR SVCS AND ADVISED ME TO CONTACT HANSCOM TWR. DUE TO EXTREME CONGESTION ON THE TWR FREQ; THE INITIAL CALL TO HANSCOM TWR WAS MADE VERY BRIEF 'HANSCOM TWR; N-NUMBER; 7 MI SW; ATIS INFO.' TWR REPLIED; '...ENTER R DOWNWIND RWY 23.' AT THIS POINT; IN SPITE OF GREAT VISIBILITY AND CLR AFTERNOON SKIES; I COULD NOT SEE THE DEP END OF RWY 23. THE DEP END WAS OBSCURED BY TREES I WOULD LATER FIGURE OUT. I WAS NOT AWARE AT FIRST THAT I WAS ON THE L DOWNWIND SIDE OF THE EXTENDED CTRLINE. USING THE ARPT DIAGRAM OF THE TERMINAL PROC FOR ORIENTATION (REF 1) PROVIDED FURTHER CONFUSION AS I DID NOT REALIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT N IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE TOP OF THE PAGE. IT IS ALIGNED TO THE L OF THE PAGE. THEREFORE; I EXPECTED TO SEE RWY 5/23 IN A DIFFERENT POS RELATIVE TO THE TWR AND TERMINAL BUILDING THAT WERE VISIBLE TO ME. I AM NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH HANSCOM FIELD; HAVING BEEN THERE ONLY 3 OR 4 TIMES; ALWAYS UNDER IFR GUIDANCE TO THE RWY. NO TERRAIN FEATURES EXIST FOR ORIENTATION SW OF HANSCOM AS IT IS WOODED OVER A LARGE AREA. ADDITIONALLY; NO VOR OR ADF NAV IS PRESENT ON THE FIELD FOR DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION. BUT A LARGE FACTOR IN ME NOT TURNING N EARLY ON TO ENTER THE TFC PATTERN OF RWY 23 FROM THE W ON R DOWNWIND WAS WORSE THAN EXPECTED PLT FATIGUE. FOR SEVERAL PRECEDING NIGHTS; MINIMAL SLEEP WAS HAD. THERE WAS PRESENT ENOUGH INFO; COMPASS HDG OF 030 DEGS; TO REALIZE THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CTRLINE FOR R DOWNWIND. AT 3 MI FROM THE ARPT; STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE THE DEP END; I DID FIGURE OUT BASED ON HDG THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CTRLINE TO ENTER R DOWNWIND. BUT NOW A STEADY STREAM OF DEPARTING ACFT PREVENTED THE TURN TO THE N. AND THE TWR FREQ WAS SO BUSY THAT I WAS UNABLE TO REQUEST A L DOWNWIND UNTIL ABOUT 1 MI FROM THE DEP END. THE TWR CTLR; NOT ANTICIPATING MY ACTUAL POS; INSISTED ON A R DOWNWIND AS PREVIOUSLY CLRED. AT THIS POINT I DETERMINED; IN HASTE; THAT I COULD SQUEEZE BTWN A DEPARTING C152 AND AN IN-TRAIL PIPER WARRIOR. A BETTER PLAN; GIVEN A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT; WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO A 180 DEG TURN OUT OF THE AREA OR JUST ENTER THE L DOWNWIND; THUS NOT REQUIRING A MANEUVER BTWN DEPARTING TFC. UNDERSTAND THOUGH THAT AT THAT MOMENT EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS WOULD HAVE REQUIRED FURTHER PLT/CTLR INTERACTION ON ALREADY CONGESTED FREQ. THE REMAINDER OF THE LNDG WAS UNEVENTFUL BESIDE THE CONTINUED EXTREME FREQ CONGESTION. SEE THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM FOR FURTHER DETAIL.

CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE RPTR; PIC; STATED THAT THEY HAD MADE A CALL TO THE TWR AFTER THE LOM HAD BEEN PASSED; BY ABOUT 1 MI OR SO. ABOUT THAT TIME THEY WERE BREAKING INTO VMC CONDITIONS; SEEING THE G2 ON A R BASE. THEY PERFORMED A GAR EVASIVE ACTION AND THE G2 LANDED RWY 11 AS PLANNED.

HOWEVER; AS PER USUAL ZBW PROCS; ANOTHER ACFT (A SAAB 340) HAD DEPARTED RWY 22R; CREATING A CONVERGING CONFLICT WITH A MISSED APCH/GAR SIT OF RWY 27. AS WE COMMENCED THE GAR; BOS TWR IMMEDIATELY ISSUED US A TURN TO 140 DEGS. THIS REMINDED US OF THE FACT WE'D SEEN AND COMMENTED ON THE SAAB IN POS ON RWY 22R; AS WE APCHED RWY 27; AND THE POTENTIAL OF CONFLICT SHOULD WE MISS AND THEY TAKE OFF. WE COMMENCED AN ASSERTIVE L TURN AND CONTINUATION OF OUR CLB. ALTHOUGH NO TCASII ALERT TOOK PLACE (TOO LOW FOR ACTIVATION?) A QUICK GLANCE OF CONCERN TO THE TCASII SHOWED A TARGET NEARLY UNDER US BY A MERE 100 FT. THIS ADDED VIGOR TO OUR MANEUVER. WE ALSO ASKED THE TWR WHERE THE SAAB WAS -- THEY SAID IT WAS GOING STRAIGHT OUT AND NOT A FACTOR. SETTLED DOWN; WE MADE A NICE VISUAL APCH AND LNDG TO RWY 29. (AN AIRBUS A320 WAS ALSO ON A LAHSO APCH TO RWY 22L; HOLD SHORT OF RWY 27 -- IMAGINE IF THEY'D MISSED APCH; TOO!). OBVIOUSLY THE GAR WAS UNUSUAL AND CONCERNING TO THE PAX; SOME COMMENTED THAT THEY'D SEEN THE OTHER ACFT AND IT WAS CLOSE. QUITE A FEW WERE ALSO AND UNDERSTANDABLY SCARED. WE MADE APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-UP PA ANNOUNCEMENTS. SUMMARY: FROM A PLT'S POINT OF VIEW; THE BOUNCE AND GAR; ALTHOUGH NOT COMMON; WAS STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WELL UNDER CTL. OUR MAIN CONCERN CAME FROM THE CLOSE VICINITY OF THE ACFT DEPARTING OFF RWY 22R; AND THE FACT THAT THE SEQUENCE OF RWY 27 LNDGS WITH RWY 22R DEPS WILL RESULT IN 'TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT' SITS; SHOULD THERE BE A RWY 27 GAR. THESE SITS NEED BE RESEQUENCED TO CONSIDER GARS; TOO; OR ELSE IT SEEMS 'ONLY A MATTER OF TIME!' CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR 469601 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE ACFT WAS TURNED SO THAT IT DID NOT PASS RWY 22L; MISSING THE SAAB BY ABOUT 1000 FT HORIZ. THE CAPT HAD TAKEN OVER THE CTLS AND MADE A TIGHT TURN TO THE ASSIGNED HDG OF 140 DEGS TO KEEP THE FLT AWAY FROM THE SAAB WHICH WAS ON A RWY HDG OF 220 DEGS BELOW THEM. THE FO RPTED THAT THIS PROC HAS BEEN IN USE FOR SOME TIME AT BOS. HE STATED THAT THE PIC DID TALK WITH THE FACILITY CHIEF; BUT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TRANSPIRED. THE CAPT ALSO TURNED IN A COMPANY RPT; BUT SO FAR AS HE KNOWS DID NOT RPT THIS TO THE UNION. THE FO WAS COUNSELED TO DO SO. ONE PROB WITH THIS PROC IS THAT THE 2 ACFT WERE ON SEPARATE FREQS; THE SAAB ON 128.8 AND THE B727 ON 119.1. WITH DEP JET TFC; THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT ON A NORMAL GAR FROM RWY 27 AND A DEP FROM RWY 22L/R AS THE JET (UNLESS VERY LIGHT) WOULD BE WELL UNDER THE FLT PATH OF A GAR ACFT FROM RWY 27. THE OTHER PROB IS THAT THE TURBOPROPS; LIKE THE SAAB; ARE LIFTING OFF SOONER; CLBING OUT ON RWY HDG AND DOES CREATE A CONFLICT AREA WITH ANY ACFT ON THE GAR FROM RWY 27.,,,,A NEAR NMAC OCCURS AT THE END OF RWY 27 WHEN A B727-200 PERFORMS A GAR AND NEARLY HITS A DEP SF340 ON INITIAL CLB OFF RWY 22R AT BOS; MA.471445,200003,0601-1200,,MA,,15,,15000,VMC,,,Daylight,,,Center ZBW.ARTCC,Air Carrier,SF 340A,,2,Part 121,IFR,Passenger,,Cruise,,Class E ZBW.E,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,,Air Carrier,Pilot Flying; Captain,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),Flight Crew Last 90 Days 250; Flight Crew Total 11000; Flight Crew Type 6500,,,,471445,Aircraft X,,Air Carrier,First Officer; Pilot Not Flying,Flight Crew Multiengine; Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Commercial,,,,,,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Other SEE AND AVOID,Horizontal 6000; Vertical 500,,Automation Air Traffic Control; Person Air Traffic Control; Person Flight Crew,,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Human Factors,Human Factors,WHILE A CRUISE AT 17000 FT ZBW CALLED TFC AT 3 O'CLOCK POS; 10 MI 15000 FT A B757.

THERE WERE MORE THAN 20 ACFT IN THE SECTOR; TSTMS IN THE VICINITY OF ENE VORTAC; WX RERTES FOR ATL; CLT; AND EWR; ALONG WITH IN TRAIL RESTRS FOR THESE AND OTHER ARPTS. AT APPROX XA05Z MY SUPVR ADVISED THAT THE NEXT SECTOR WOULD NOT TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL ACFT. I BEGAN ISSUING VECTORS; ALT CHANGES; TO KEEP ACFT IN MY AIRSPACE; AND SET UP HOLDING. ACR X WAS ONE OF 4 ACFT IN TRAIL FOR JFK AND APCHING THE SECTOR BOUNDARY. I ISSUED ALL 4 ACFT RADAR VECTORS HDG 180 DEGS INTO AN ADJOINING SECTOR THAT WAS NOT AS BUSY AS DIRECTED BY MY SUPVR. AUTOMATED HDOF HAD BEEN INITIATED TO THE FIRST SECTOR; SO I REINITIATED THE HDOFS FOR ALL 4 ACFT TO THE ADJOINING SECTOR. THE COMPUTER INPUT FOR ACR X WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND CONTINUED TO 'FLASH' TO THE ORIGINAL SECTOR. I DID NOT NOTICE THIS ERROR. SUBSEQUENTLY; THE ORIGINAL SECTOR UNEXPLAINABLY ACCEPTED THE HDOF ON ACR X. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD REINITIATED THE HDOF TO THE ADJACENT SECTOR SUCCESSFULLY; AND THAT; THEREFORE; HE HAD ACCEPTED THE HDOF. THE RADAR ASSOCIATE CTLR DROPPED THE DATA BLOCK FROM MY DISPLAY PRIOR TO MY ISSUING A FREQ CHANGE TO THE ACFT; AND I FAILED TO NOTICE AND CORRECT THE SIT. THE ACFT FLEW FOR 8-10 MINS THROUGH THE NEXT SECTOR; WITH ONLY A LIMITED DATA BLOCK DISPLAYED; WHICH THE NEXT CTLR NEVER NOTICED. THE NEXT CTLR VECTORED ANOTHER ACFT INTO ACR X. AT XA15Z ACR X RPTED A TCASII CLB ON MY FREQ. I DETERMINED THE ACFT'S POS; THAT SEPARATION HAD BEEN RE-ESTABLISHED; THEN CHANGED THE ACFT TO THE PROPER FREQ. THE PROB WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE TO REINITIATE THE HDOF TO THE CORRECT SECTOR. THIS WAS AFFECTED BY VERY HIGH TFC VOLUME AND COMPLEXITY. OTHER ASSOCIATED SYS PROBS THAT OCCURRED AFFECTING THE OUTCOME: POOR FLOW CTL; NO WARNING OF A 'RED SECTOR;' SUPVR NOT ASSIGNING A HDOF CTLR AS EXTRA HELP; UNEXPLAINED ACTION OF THE CTLR ACCEPTING THE HDOF AFTER STATING THEY WOULD TAKE NO MORE ACFT AND THEN NOT SAYING OR DOING ANYTHING WHEN THE ACFT FLEW AROUND HIS SECTOR; FAILURE OF THE CTLR AND SUPVR TO NOTICE A LIMITED DATA BLOCK FOR 8-10 MINS IN HIS AIRSPACE AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION. THANKFULLY; TCASII WORKS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 472329: ON MAY/XA/00 I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS AT SECTOR 2. TFC MGMNT UNIT HAD WX RERTES IN FOR ATL AND EWR SENDING BOTH RTES OVER BOS. THIS; IN ADDITION TO THE JFK ARRS; PHL AND SOUTHERN EAST COAST BOUND ACFT THAT ARE OVER BOS. WE WERE ISSUING THE RERTES AND PROVIDING 20 MI IN TRAIL TO ATL; IAD; ALL TFC RTED OVER CMK AND IN TRAIL FOR JFK. IN EFFECT; TFC MGMNT UNIT HAD EVERYTHING FUNNELING DOWN TO 1 SPOT TO GO E AROUND AN EBOUND WX SYS. WHEN THE WX CLOSED IN; THE DOOR GOT SLAMMED AND SECTOR 46; OVER BOS; SHUT US OFF WITH NO NOTICE. WE HAD 20 SOME ACFT WITH NO PLACE TO GO. THE RADAR CTLR BEGAN VECTORING TO CONTAIN THE ACFT N OUR SECTOR. I BEGAN WORKING TO TRY TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT THEM. THE SECTOR TO OUR SE; SECTOR 17; VOLUNTEERED TO OFFLOAD THE JFK TFC. THE RADAR CTLR TURNED THE FIRST 4 ACFT TO 180 DEG HDGS. THE FIRST 3 WERE FLASHED TO SECTOR 17; THE LAST WAS STILL FLASHING TO SECTOR 46. AS SECTOR 17 TOOK THE FIRST 3; THEY WERE SWITCHED. SECTOR 46 ACCEPTED THE HDOF ON THE 4TH ACR X; ALTHOUGH HE WAS NOW HEADED INTO SECTOR 17. THE RADAR CTLR WAS NOW ISSUING HOLDING TO ACFT AND I WAS UPDATING THE DATABASE TO OFFLOAD THE EWR ACFT TO THE LOW SECTOR. NEITHER ONE OF US NOTICED THAT ACR X WAS HANDED OFF TO THE WRONG SECTOR AND HAD NOT BEEN FREQ CHANGED. 7 MINS LATER; THE ACR X RPTED CLBING ON A TCASII RESOLUTION. THE ACR X; WHOM WAS NOT DISPLAYED ON SECTOR 17; HAD CROSSED BACK OVER ACR Y. EVEN AT THAT POINT WE XFERRED COMS AND DID NOT REALIZE WE HAD ENTERED SECTOR 17 WITHOUT A HDOF. TFC MGMNT DID NOTHING TO ASSIST US AS THE TFC SIT DETERIORATED. THEY PUT EVERYONE DOWN ONE RTE; BUT BECAUSE EACH RESTR WAS ISSUED SEPARATELY THEY FAILED TO SEE THAT THEY WERE OVERLOADING ONE SECTOR. EVEN AFTER THE SECTOR OVERLOAD SOFTWARE ALERTED THEM THEY FAILED TO MONITOR THE SIT AND TAKE ACTION.

STERLING IS CTLED BY GLIDER OPS -- ESPECIALLY DURING WKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. GLIDERS ARE STREWN ABOUT THE LNDG AND T-OFF AREA AT ALL TIMES. MOST FREQUENTLY; THEY ARE CONGREGATED AT THE APCH END OF RWY 34 (OR RWY 16) ON THE GRASS. TO GET TO THE PAVED RWY 34 DEP VIA TAXIING ON THE TXWY IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS THERE ARE A SCORE OF HUMANS DANGEROUSLY RUNNING ACROSS; BACK AND FORTH AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS DOWN THERE. IN THIS WRITER'S OPINION; A NOTAM SHOULD BE ISSUED SUGGESTING DEPARTING ACFT TAKE OFF ON THE GRASS; IN FRONT OF THE TOW AND GLIDER PLANES; ONCE IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE INTENT FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF. THEN; IMMEDIATELY AFTER TKOF; FLY AWAY FROM THE RWY AT AN ANGLE; AS GLIDERS MIGHT BE APCHING TO LAND AT ANY TIME IN ANY DIRECTION WITHOUT CTL. ON THE DAY STATED ABOVE; A FELLOW CLRING THE WAY FOR A TUG AND GLIDER TO TAKE OFF (BUT NOT YET READY) RAN IN FRONT OF MY PROP AS IF TO SAY HE (WITHOUT A PLANE) HAD THE RWY. I WAITED UNTIL THEY TIED THE GLIDER AND SUBSEQUENTLY THEY TOOK OFF. I MADE A SWEEP OF THE BASE LEG AND FINAL; MADE THE TKOF ANNOUNCEMENT ON 122.9 AND 122.75 AS PEOPLE FREQUENTLY USE THAT FREQ THERE TOO; THEN TOOK OFF FOLLOWING THE C182 TUG WITH GLIDER IN TOW. THEN; AN INTERESTING THING HAPPENED. I BECAME CAUGHT IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE C182 TUG WAKE TURB OF TIP VORTEX. FOR A MOMENT; LATERAL CTL BECAME DIFFICULT AS IT ABRUPTLY ROLLED ME TO THE R; NEAR THE RWY. AT FULL PWR; I WAS QUICKLY OUT OF IT; THEN DECIDED TO PROCEED AT ABOUT A 45 DEG ANGLE DEP FROM THE RWY; ABOUT 3/4 DISTANCE FROM THE APCH END. AT THIS TIME; I NOTED THE TUG AND GLIDER ALSO IN A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL TURN TO THE R; OFF THE DEP END. AS I WAS FASTER; I KEPT MY PLANE LOW; WHILE ACCELERATING AND REMAINING CLR OF THE TUG AND GLIDER. AGAIN; THERE ARE NO NOTAMS AT THE FSS IN BANGOR ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE -- NO RECOMMENDED PATTERN OR GND TAXI NOTAMS (THERE HAS BEEN A NOTAM ABOUT 'TWR LIGHT' OUTAGE (FOR NIGHTS?). IN THE AOPA ARPT DIRECTORY; THERE IS A NOTE THAT GLIDERS USE A R PATTERN; WHILE PWRED PLANES ARE TO USE A NORMAL L PATTERN (PWRED FOR LNDG; I ASSUME). A MENTION OF INTENSE INSTRUCTIONAL AND SOARING FLTS IS ALSO MENTIONED (ASSUMING ONE USES THIS DIRECTORY). CONTRARY TO THIS; ONE WILL FIND GLIDERS COMING IN FROM R AND L PATTERNS AND TUGS AND GLIDERS USING A L PATTERN AFTER TAKING OFF. A WHILE BACK; WHILE ON TKOF ROLL RWY 34; A GLIDER LANDED IN FRONT OF ME IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON RWY 16. ADDITIONALLY; ONE TIME A FELLOW IN A PIPER TOMAHAWK; AFTER ANNOUNCING 'DOWNWIND FOR RWY 34' LANDED NOSE-TO-NOSE ON RWY 16 WHILE I WAS ROLLING OUT ON LNDG ON RWY 34. IN MY OPINION; THERE SHOULD BE AN FAA NOTAM ADVISING PLTS 'SOMETHING' OF THE DANGERS ABOUT PEOPLE ON THE RWY; UNUSUAL TFC PATTERN PROCS. A PUBLISHED DISCRETE FREQ OTHER THAN PLANE-TO-PLANE MULTICOM (AS 122.9 AND 122.75 ARE ALMOST ALWAYS ACTIVE ELSEWHERE; BLOCKING ADVISORIES DURING BUSY TIMES); THEN POSSIBLY A SUGGESTION TO MINIMIZE TIME IN THE TFC PATTERN AND NEAR THE RWY ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE BEEN FLYING IN AND OUT OF STERLING FOR ABOUT 40 YRS; MOSTLY VISITING FRIENDS. THE SIT THERE IS GOING TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND FATALITY. I KNOW ABOUT IT AND MINIMIZE MY EXPOSURE; BUT ONE DAY A TRANSIENT WILL BE CAUGHT UP IN THE DANGEROUS; UNCTLED SIT.,,,,RPT OF CHAOS AT STERLING ARPT; MA.

MY STUDENT; A PVT-INST RATED PLT WAS FLYING THE AIRPLANE ON THE L SIDE. I WAS SEATED ON THE R. WE DEPARTED RWY 23 AT BEDFORD WITH THE INTENT TO HEAD TOWARDS OUR PRACTICE AREA NW OF THE FIELD 12 NM AWAY. WE MADE A NORMAL TKOF AND CLBOUT TO THE PRACTICE AREA. VISIBILITY WAS GOOD AT THE TIME; ALTHOUGH WE WERE FLYING INTO THE SUN. AS WE CONTINUED OUR CLBOUT THROUGH 2500 FT (ESTIMATED); MY STUDENT OBSERVED TFC OFF OF OUR L SIDE. MY STUDENT TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TURNING AND CLBING TO THE R. THE DASH 8 ACFT TURNED AWAY AND TO THEIR R. DURING OUR CLBOUT MY STUDENT AND I HAD OUR ATTN OUTSIDE THE AIRPLANE. HOWEVER; BECAUSE WE WERE CLBING AND THE DASH 8 WAS DSNDING AT HIGH SPD MY STUDENT WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE OTHER ACFT UNTIL IT WAS IN CLOSE PROX. MY STUDENT'S ACTIONS WERE IMMEDIATE AND DELIBERATE AND WE MADE A STEEP BANK AWAY FROM THE TFC. AT THE CLOSEST POINT I ESTIMATE OUR DISTANCE TO BE 500 FT FROM THE OTHER ACFT. THE DASH 8 SPD AT THE TIME HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY ME TO BE IN EXCESS OF 150 KTS. OUR SPD AT THE TIME WAS BTWN 75 KTS AND 80 KTS. NO TA WAS NOTED BY ME TO HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO US BY THE TWR. WE WERE UNAWARE OF THE TFC CONFLICT UNTIL THE POINT WHEN WE SAW AND AVOIDED THE TFC. IN MY OPINION; THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS OR PRECAUTIONS THAT MY FLT COULD HAVE TAKEN; OR I COULD HAVE TAKEN TO AVOID THE SIT. I FEEL THAT DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO SCAN FOR TFC; BECAUSE OF THE CLB ATTITUDE WE WERE IN; IT WAS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT US TO SEE THE TFC ANY SOONER; ESPECIALLY WITH THE DASH 8 DSNDING NOSE LOW AT HIGH VELOCITY.,,,,PA28 INSTRUCTOR AND PLT WERE REQUIRED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION DEPARTING BED ARPT.474795,200005,0601-1200,BOS.Airport,MA,,5,,800,Marginal,Rain; 10,,Daylight,2000,,Tower BOS.Tower,Corporate,Jet/Long Ranger/206,,1,Part 135,VFR,Photo Shoot,,Cruise,Other TOBIN,Class B BOS.B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tower BOS.Tower,Air Carrier,Light Transport; Low Wing; 2 Turboprop Eng,,2,Part 119,IFR,Passenger,Localizer/Glideslope/ILS 15R,Descent,Other Circling,Class B BOS.B,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,,Corporate,Single Pilot; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Commercial; Flight Crew Flight Instructor; Flight Crew Instrument,Flight Crew Last 90 Days 120; Flight Crew Total 7000; Flight Crew Type 5500,,,,474795,Aircraft Y,,Air Carrier,Pilot Flying; Captain,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence; Other ATC HANDLING,Horizontal 6000; Vertical 200,,Person Flight Crew,,General None Reported / Taken,Staffing; Weather; Company Policy; Human Factors; Airspace Structure,Human Factors,INITIALLY I WAS NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THIS; HOWEVER; I FEEL THAT THE TWR WORKING SPLIT FREQS (ONE FREQ FOR HELIS AND TFC/PHOTO FIXED WING AND ONE FOR AIRLINE ARRS AND DEPS SIMULTANEOUSLY) MAY BE A PROB AT TIMES. I WAS FLYING A BELL HELI OVER FENWAY PARK AREA ON A 1500 FT OR 2000 FT AND BELOW CLRNC FOR PHOTO WORK TO THE W OF THE ARPT. THERE WERE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND WITH VARYING VISIBILITY. NORMALLY; WE OPERATE THE HELIS 1000 FT AND BELOW. I WAS WORKING HIGHER FOR A PARTICULAR SHOT. ONCE COMPLETE; I REQUESTED THE TOBIN RTE FOR A NE DEP. I RECEIVED AN APPROVAL; QUICKLY FOR THE RTE. I HAD SOME CONCERN; AS I COULD HEAR THE CTLR'S VERY BUSY SIDE OF HER CONVERSATION WORKING THE OTHER FREQ AT THE SAME TIME AND EARLIER THEY HAD BEEN ARRIVING (TURBOPROPS) ON THE RWY 15R APCH AND CIRCLE DOWN THE HARBOR; LAND ON RWY 4L TO THE NE. SHE WAS VERY QUICK WITH 'APPROVED AS REQUESTED;' NOT MENTIONING ANYTHING ABOUT MY ALT. I CALLED BACK TO CONFIRM WITH ATC THAT I WAS GOING OUTBOUND ON THE TOBIN RTE. I THEN RECEIVED AN 'APPROVED AS REQUESTED; DSND TO 800 FT FOR THE TOBIN RTE.' WHILE DSNDING; I SWITCHED SOME FREQS FOR THE TRIP OUTBOUND ON THE SECOND RADIO. UPON REACHING THE START OF THE TOBIN RTE AT 800 FT AND ABOUT 1 MI FROM XING THE RWY 15R APCH COURSE; JUST WHERE THE TURBOPROPS START MAKING THEIR R TURNS VISUALLY DOWN THE HARBOR FOR RWY 4L; I LOOKED AT MY 1 O'CLOCK POS AND ABOUT 1 MI AND A TURBOPROP WAS MAKING HIS R TURN DOWN THE HARBOR. ALTHOUGH A SURPRISING SIGHT; BECAUSE THE TWR HAD MADE NO MENTION OF THE TFC; NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY. I CONTINUED OUT THE TOBIN RTE XING THE RWY 15R COURSE WITHOUT INCIDENT. WHILE XING I SAW DISTANT; 10 MI OR SO; LIGHTS OF ANOTHER ACFT FOR THE SAME APCH. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO INCIDENT THERE; I DO FEEL I WAS GETTING SECOND RATE ATTN TO MY OP WITH WHATEVER TIME THE CTLR HAD LEFT OVER WHILE SHE WAS WORKING THE OTHER MUCH BETTER FREQ. 1) AFTER I RECONFIRMED MY RTE OUTBOUND; I WAS THEN TOLD TO DSND TO A LOWER ALT. 2) I WAS NEVER ALERTED TO INBOUND TFC ON THE RWY 15R CIRCLE TO RWY 4L APCH. AGAIN NO INCIDENT; BUT WHAT ABOUT NEXT TIME? I FEEL WHENEVER EITHER FREQ GETS BUSY; ANOTHER CTLR SHOULD TAKE ONE. IF IT'S BUSY ENOUGH TO BE CLASS B AIRSPACE; THEN IT SHOULD BE STAFFED TO THAT LEVEL.

UPON REACHING THE ARPT THE WX HAD CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY TO A 700 FT OVCST LAYER. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR MVY. THE DECISION TO DO THE ILS TO RWY 24 WAS AGREED UPON BY BOTH THE CAPT AND MYSELF. THIS APCH SET UP AND BRIEFED WELL BEFORE REACHING THE ARPT. BEFORE REACHING THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OF MVY IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT MVY WAS VERY BUSY JUST BY THE AMOUNT OF RADIO TFC ON APCH CTL (IT WAS JUL/SAT/00). WE WERE VECTORED TO AND WERE CLRED FOR THE ILS RWY 24; WHICH WE DID. JUST PRIOR TO AND BEFORE REACHING THE FINAL APCH FIX (FAF) WE WERE HANDED OFF TO AND TOLD TO CONTACT MVY TWR. BECAUSE OF RADIO TFC SATURATION WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY CONTACT TWR CTL AS INSTRUCTED. JUST AFTER REACHING THE FAF/GS INTERCEPT AND WHILE DSNDING ON THE GS WE RECEIVED A TA ALERT ON THE TCASII. IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY I ARRESTED MY DSCNT ON THE GS. THE CAPT ACQUIRED A HIGH WING CESSNA IN FRONT OF AND BELOW US IN THE ILS APCH CORRIDOR. TO CONTINUE THE DSCNT ON THE GS WOULD HAVE AT THE VERY LEAST RESULTED IN A NEAR MISS AND AT THE VERY WORST A MIDAIR COLLISION. AS PF I ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH. IN THE 10-15 SECONDS THAT HAD ELAPSED FROM OUR HDOF FROM APCH TO TWR WE WERE VERY BUSY BOTH FLYING AND VISUALLY ACQUIRING OUR TA. AT THE VERY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO CONTACT TWR BECAUSE OF RADIO TFC SATURATION WE DID. BECAUSE I HAD ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH THE CAPT CHKED IN WITH MVY TWR; 'LTT WITH YOU ILS RWY 24 GOING MISSED APCH.' WE PROCEEDED TO THE MISSED APCH AND DID THE PUBLISHED MISSED APCH. AT NO TIME PRIOR TO THIS DID WE CANCEL IFR NOR ACCEPT A VISUAL APCH. UPON OUR CHK IN WITH TWR THAT WE WERE GOING MISSED APCH WE WERE QUERIED AS TO WHY? THEY WERE INFORMED THAT WE HAD VISUALLY ACQUIRED TFC IN THE APCH CORRIDOR AND IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY HAD ELECTED TO GO MISSED APCH. WE REQUESTED FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS AND RECEIVED VECTORS BACK TO THE ILS RWY 24 WHICH WE DID AND LANDED AT MVY. IN CONCLUSION I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE CESSNA THAT WAS IN OUR APCH CORRIDOR WAS ON A SPECIAL VFR CLRNC BECAUSE OF THE 700 FT CEILING.

ASOS: CLEAR SKY'S; HIGH ALTIMETER SETTING (30.24+); WIND FROM THE S AT 7 KNOTS. 8 NM S OF ARPT BOS APCH CLEARED US FOR A VISUAL TO FIT. BOS APCH REPORTED A SINGE TFC ACFT AT OUR L POS. WE VISUALLY ACQUIRED THE TFC ACFT (EASTERLY BOUND-LOWER ALTITUDE) AND WE MANEUVERED TO THE W. THIS WAS HE ONLY TFC ACFT WE KNEW ABOUT IN THE FIT AREA. 5 -- 3 NM S OF THE ARPT (OUR LOCATION WAS W OF RWY 2/20 EXTENDED CTRLINE) WE REPORTED OUR POS AND INTENTION (IE LNDG RWY 14 AT FITCHBURG). AS WE CONFIGURED THE ACFT FOR LNDG I NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BUILT-UP RESIDENTIAL AREA ON THE APCH END FOR RWY 14. A DECISION WAS MADE TO KEEP THE ACFT AT THE MINIMUM POWER SETTING FOR NOISE ABATEMENT [POSSIBLE FACTOR CONCERNING DECONFLICTION]. WHILE IN A R TURN; WITHIN 20 -- 30 OF THE RWY HEADING; WE RECEIVE THE FIRST RADIO CALL FROM AN ACFT ON FINAL FOR RWY 20 AT FITCHBURG. MY MIND THOUGHT BACK TO THE PREVIOUS BOS REPORTED TFC ACFT... I COULD NOT FATHOM HOW THAT ACFT COULD HAVE TRANSITIONED TO RWY 20 FOR LNDG. I CLEARED THE APCH END FOR RWY 20. I THOUGHT; MAYBE THE REPORTING ACFT MEANT RWY 02 BY MISTAKE. I IMMEDIATELY VISUALLY CLEARED RWY 02 AND THE APCH END OF RWY 02; VISUALLY I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING. I WENT BACK TO RWY 20 APCH END AND STILL COULD NOT FIND AN ACFT. BY NOW WE WERE IN THE FLAIR AND LNDG OUR ACFT. AS WE APCH THE INTERSECTION OF RWY 14/20 I AGAIN CLRED ALL OF RWY 20/20 FOR ANY TFC. I DID NOT SEE ACFT AT ALL. WE RPTED PAST THE INTERSECTION ON THE RADIO AND CLRED RWY 14 AT THE END. WHILE TAXIING IN TO THE REFUELING PAD; A REMARK WAS MADE ON THE UNICOM FREQUENCY 'I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT LEAR'. I STATED THAT I DID NOT WANT TO DISCUSS THIS ON THE RADIO. I MARVELED AT HOW 'SOON' THIS ACFT COULD HAVE COMPLETED A GAR; PATTERN COMPLETION AND LNDG INSIDE OF 1 MIN. I FOUND OUT AFTER THE FACT THAT THE OTHER INCIDENT ACFT HAD MODIFIED HIS PATTERN AND COMPLETED A TIGHT 360 TO LAND ON RWY 20. AFTER DISEMBARKING THE ACFT I NOTICED THE INDIVIDUAL AT HAND. I WALKED OVER TO DISCUSS THE SIT WITH HIM; ONLY TO NOTICE THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD NO INTENTION ON DISCUSSING THE SIT. HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN STATING 'DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM'; 'LET'S JUST PULL THE TAPES'; ETC; ETC. I LATER FOUND OUT THAT THE CESSNA 182 ACFT OWNER/OPERATOR ALONG WITH 2 NON-PILOT RIDERS WAS A MR. Z APPARENTLY HE WAS RETIRED FROM THE MA DOT/STATE DEPT - AVIATION... I LATER FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS GOING TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH THE FAA. THE DISPOSITION IS UNKNOWN. THE ONLY SUGGESTION I CAN MAKE IS THE PROVERBIAL HEADS UP WHEN ARR AND DEP UNCONTROLLED ARPTS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A REOCCURRING PROB UNTIL WE HAVE CONTROL TOWERS AT EVERY ARPT IN THE UNITED STATES. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I WAS 'TAKEN ABACK' BY MR.Z STATEMENT 'DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?' ANY STATEMENT AS SUCH IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE AND ABSOLUTELY UNCALLED FOR IN THE AVIATION ARENA!

THE FO AND I WATCHED THE TFC AND BOTH COMMENTED ON HOW CLOSE IT LOOKED. AFTER A FEW SECONDS; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT IN ANTICIPATION OF LOWERING THE NOSE. ABOUT THEN; THE TCASII ISSUED AN RA AND I LOWERED THE NOSE MORE. THE OTHER ACFT WENT OVER US L TO R AND A CLR OF CONFLICT WAS HEARD. SOON; THE CTLR ASKED IF WE HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE TFC IN VISUAL CONTACT. THE FO RPTED NO. WE SAW THE TFC COMING AND I STARTED TO REACT BEFORE THE TCASII; BUT IT STILL WAS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. IN OVER 30 YRS OF FLYING LARGE ACFT; THIS IS A FIRST. I DON'T THINK IT IS SAFE TO ALLOW VISUAL SEPARATION FOR JET ACFT. IT IS TOO HARD TO JUDGE THE SEPARATION AND CLOSURE RATES. I WILL NOT ACCEPT ONE AGAIN AND THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION ON BOTH AIRPLANES THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WILL DO; BUT YOU DON'T.

WE WERE HEADING APPROX 75 DEGS DIRECT TO LOBBY. PASSING THROUGH 4500 FT MSL; OUR TCASII GAVE US A TA ON AN ACFT BELOW AND TO OUR R AT 1.5 MI. THE TCASII RESOLUTION DIRECTED US TO DSND AT 1200-1400 FPM TO AVOID THE TFC. I TOOK THIS ACTION AT THE SAME TIME THE CTLR INSTRUCTED US TO CLB TO 4000 FT MSL. SIMULTANEOUSLY; THE PNF ACQUIRED THE TFC VISUALLY; AND TALKED MY EYES ONTO THE TFC. THE TFC WAS XING R TO L ON A NORTHERLY HDG. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED TO THE R (S) SO AS TO LAG THE COLLISION COURSE AND FURTHER INCREASE THE LATERAL SEPARATION ALONG WITH THE TCASII COMMAND FOR VERT SEPARATION. THE VISUAL EVASIVE ACTION ACTUALLY SHALLOWED MY DSCNT TO LEVEL FLT; AND WE PASSED BEHIND THE CESSNA BY APPROX 550-1000 FT LATERALLY; AND SLIGHTLY HIGH ON THE FLT PATH. IT IS OF INTEREST TO NOTE; THAT AS MY FLT PATH SHALLOWED OUT BY MY VISUAL MANEUVERING; THE TCASII COMMANDED AN IMMEDIATE CLB. I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TCASII TO THIS FLUID MANEUVERING/ENVIRONMENT. NO PRIOR WARNING OF TFC WAS GIVEN TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT BY APCH CTL. IF THIS HAD BEEN A TRUE IMC OR NON-VISUAL EVENT; I BELIEVED THE TCASII WAS CORRECT FROM MY SIGHT PICTURE; AND THE COMMANDED DSCNT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US RIGHT UNDER THE CESSNA WITHOUT INCURRING A COLLISION. THE XING ANGLE WAS A TRUE COLLISION COURSE; AND WOULD HAVE PLACED US DIRECTLY UNDER THE CESSNA'S FLT PATH.

ABEAM THE THRESHOLD OF RWY 29 WE WERE TOLD TO 'TAKE IT STRAIGHT TO THE NUMBERS' WHICH REQUIRED US TO TURN L BASE; PASSING BTWN 2 CESSNA SINGLES ON THE L DOWNWIND TO RWY 29. DURING A SHORT BASE-TO-FINAL TURN; I HEARD THE CTLR TELL A PLANE TO 'HAVE THE PWR UP' WHILE IN POS AND HOLD ON RWY 29. AS I ROLLED OUT ON FINAL; THE PIPER SINGLE HOLDING IN POS WAS CLRED FOR TKOF AND STARTED THE ROLL. ON SHORT FINAL; I HEARD THE CTLR TELL A NAVAJO TO GO AROUND USING A CALL SIGN; I BELIEVE CONTAINING THE NUMBERS 'X' AND 'Y.' WITH APCHS TO MULTIPLE INTERSECTING RWYS IN USE; I WAS NOT SURE WE WERE THE NAVAJO IN QUESTION AS OUR CALL SIGN IS NOT SIMILAR. I REQUESTED CLARIFICATION; NOTING THE PIPER WAS AIRBORNE BY NOW AND PRIOR TO OUR TOUCHDOWN. NO RESPONSE WAS MADE. AFTER CLRING THE RWY PER TWR INSTRUCTION; THE GND CTLR ASKED IF WE HAD HEARD THE INSTRUCTION TO GO AROUND. I SAID THAT I HAD HEARD A GAR INSTRUCTION; BUT THAT IT WAS ISSUED TO ANOTHER CALL SIGN.

AS THE HELI MOVED TO OUR 1 O'CLOCK POS AND NO LONGER A FACTOR WE ACQUIRED IT VISUALLY AND DISCONTINUED THE CLB MANEUVER COMMANDED BY TCASII AND SALVAGED THE APCH. A SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WITH THE TWR SUPVR ELICITED AN APOLOGY ON BEHALF OF HIS SUBORDINATE FOR NOT RPTING THE TFC TO US PRIOR TO TCASII DOING SO. STILL; I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLICY IN PLACE.

THE RPTR WAS NOT SURE ABOUT THE TIMELINESS OF THE TA; AS THE FO LATER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HEARD THE LCL CTLR ADVISE THAT THE HELI HAD THEM IN SIGHT.

THE ONLY TWR LISTED NEAR ORH WAS ONE TO THE NNW 1.7 MI AWAY. I CALLED BURLINGTON FSS AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE UNLIT TWR AND ITS LOCATION. WHEN I CAME BACK ON SHIFT AT XA00; I CHKED THE NOTAMS FOR THE TWR; IT STILL WAS NOT LISTED. I CALLED BUR FSS AGAIN AND ASKED ABOUT THE TWR. THEY SAID IT WAS BDR (BRIDGEPORT'S) AREA AND TO CALL THEM TO SEE WHY IT DIDN'T GET POSTED. I CALLED BDR AND ASKED A BRIEFER ABOUT THE TWR.

APPROX 1 MIN LATER THE MOONEY WAS CLRED FOR TKOF. A FEW SECONDS LATER WE WERE CLRED FOR 'IMMEDIATE' TKOF. WE OBSERVED ANOTHER PILATUS ON ABOUT A 1 MI FINAL. WE PULLED ONTO THE RWY TO BEGIN OUR GND ROLL; BUT HAD TO STOP DUE TO THE SLOW MOVING MOONEY IN FRONT OF US.

IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROB HAD THE ACFT ON THE RWY BEEN ONE OF SIMILAR PERFORMANCE. IF WE HAD BEEN OPERATING AT AN UNCTLED FIELD I WOULD HAVE NEVER ATTEMPTED THIS TKOF; BUT BECAUSE THE CTLR HAD GIVEN ME THE 'CLRNC' I ELECTED TO CONTINUE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CTLRS SHOULD NEVER GIVE A CLRNC FOR AN IMMEDIATE TKOF WHEN ANOTHER ACFT WITH MUCH SLOWER PERFORMANCE HAS JUST DEPARTED.

WE WERE APPROX 100 FT AGL; TWR INSTRUCTED US TO GO AROUND AND FLY RWY HEADING. AT APPROX 500 FT MSL; I SAW A REGIONAL JET CONVERGING FROM ABOVE. WE TOOK EVASIVE ACTION TO AVOID. IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WITH THE TWR SUPVR; HE INFORMED ME THAT HORIZ SEPARATION HAD BEEN 1200 FT AND VERT SEPARATION 100 FT. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR: 1) REGIONAL JET HAD DEPARTED RWY 22R AT BOS. SID DIRECTS A TURN TO 140 DEGS AFTER TKOF; BRINGING THE ACFT ACROSS THE CTRLINE OF RWY 22L. BOS TWR USES 2 DIFFERENT FREQS FOR CTL OF THESE RWYS; 119.1 FOR RWY 22L AND 128.8 FOR RWY 22R. THE CTLR DELAYED HIS INSTRUCTION FOR THE REGIONAL JET TO TURN R FOR 12 SECONDS; CAUSING THE RJ TO CROSS OUR PATH. MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS COMPROMISED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW TFC WAS DEPARTING RWY 22R AS WE WENT AROUND BECAUSE HE WAS ON A DIFFERENT FREQ. 2) FOR SOME REASON; EITHER PLT ERROR OR ACFT MALFUNCTION; GAR MODE WAS NEVER ACHIEVED WITH THE FLT MGMNT GUIDANCE COMPUTER OF OUR ACFT. THIS CREATED A HAZARDOUS SIT IN AND OF ITSELF. UPON LNDG GEAR RETRACTION; A MASTER WARNING ALARM SOUNDED WITH ACCOMPANYING FLASHING RED LIGHT. THIS OCCURRED AT APPROX 300 FT MSL; JUST BEFORE I SAW THE CONFLICT WITH THE RJ; DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ACFT WAS STILL IN THE LAND MODE AND THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO LAND WITH THE GEAR UP. THIS FURTHER COMPROMISED MY SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TO THE POINT WHERE I FEEL IT WAS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT THIS DID NOT RESULT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. AS TO WHY GAR MODE WAS NOT ACHIEVED; WHEN TWR INSTRUCTED A GAR; I ACKNOWLEDGED AND ANTICIPATED THE FO'S (THE PF) REQUIRED CALLOUT OF 'GAR; TOGA.' HE DID NOT MAKE THE CALLOUT; SO I PROMPTED HIM WITH 'GAR; TOGA.' HE RESPONDED BY ESTABLISHING A CLB ATTITUDE AND PUSHED THE THRUST LEVERS FORWARD. WE BOTH FAILED TO VERIFY THAT TOGA WAS ANUNCIATED ON THE FLT MODE ANNUNCIATOR. I WAS LOOKING AT THE FLAP HANDLE AND PROMPTING HIM TO CALL FOR GAR FLAPS; WHICH HE HAD FAILED TO DO. THE FO CONTENDS THAT HE DID INDEED SELECT TOGA WITH THE THRUST LEVERS. I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT GAR MODE WAS NOT ACHIEVED BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO SELECT TOGA WITH THE THRUST LEVERS. OUR (WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON 'MY') FAILURE TO VERIFY THAT TOGA HAD BEEN ACHIEVED WAS AS LARGE A FACTOR AS THE DELAY IN THE TWR INSTRUCTING THE RJ TO TURN. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE CAPT STATED THAT AS HE WAS DETERMINING THE REASON FOR THE MASTER CAUTION LIGHT; THE FO WAS INITIATING A TURN TO AVOID THE DEPARTING ERJ-135 XING IN FRONT OF THEM.

THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL INTO A RIVER AT APPROX 6.5 DME SW OF BOS ARPT. WE WENT DIRECTLY TO THIS SCENE FROM A PREVIOUS STORY. WE THEN VIDEOTAPED THE OIL SPILL AND DID A LIVE RPT ON TV. I THEN TOLD THE STATION THAT WE WERE LEAVING FOR BEVERLY ARPT FOR FUEL. NEXT; I CALLED BOSTON SKYWAYS (BOS TWR FOR BOS CLASS B VFR HELI AND FIXED WING ACFT) FOR CLRNC TO GO TO BEVERLY ARPT. BOSTON SKYWAYS THEN SAID THAT IT WAS APPROVED; 'BUT I'LL NEED YOU AT 500 FT BEFORE PASSING UNDER THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE.' I ACKNOWLEDGED THE RESTR AND STARTED NE TOWARD GRAVES LIGHT AND A DSCNT OUT OF 1000 FT FOR 500 FT. AS SOON AS I ACKNOWLEDGED THE RESTR; THE TV STATION CALLED ME ON THE FM RADIO AND ASKED WHAT THE TURNAROUND TIME WOULD BE TO REFUEL AND GO BACK TO THE OIL SPILL. I SAID APPROX 45 MINS TO 1 HR. AS I CONTINUED TO DSND AND FLY NE; THE CTLR ASKED ME IF I HAD A B737 AT MY 2 O'CLOCK POS IN SIGHT. I SAID NO. I LEVELED THE HELI AT 500 FT APPROX 1 1/2 MI PRIOR TO XING THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE AND CONTINUED TOWARD GRAVES. JUST E OF THE RWY 33 COURSE; THE CTLR ASKED AGAIN IF I SAW THE B737 TO THE NE AT 1600 FT. I SAID YES; AND WOULD MAINTAIN VISUAL SEPARATION. WHEN WELL E OF THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE; THE CTLR SAID I COULD CLB TO 1000 FT ENRTE TO BEVERLY ARPT. HERE IS MY DILEMMA: AFTER LNDG AT BEVERLY ARPT; I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE VERBIAGE THE CTLR USED. I AM 90% CERTAIN THAT HE SAID HE NEEDED ME AT 500 FT PRIOR OR BEFORE XING THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE. HOWEVER; AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT; I HAVE SOME QUESTION THAT HE MAY HAVE SAID HE NEEDED ME AT 500 FT WHILE 'ENRTE' FOR PASSING UNDER THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE -- WHICH; IF THAT WERE TRUE; I SHOULD HAVE DSNDED OVER MY LOCATION TO 500 FT AND THEN PROCEEDED ON COURSE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS; ALTHOUGH THE CTLR NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT INDICATED THERE WAS CONCERN OR A PROB AND THE FLT WAS FINE; I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECALL EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED AND AFTER LNDG; I COULD NOT. I BELIEVE I MADE THE MISTAKE IN NOT GIVING 100% ATTN TO ATC INSTRUCTIONS. WHEN FLYING A MULTI-TASK JOB; IE; ENG; EMS; PWR LINES; LIFT WORK; ETC; THERE CAN BE MANY DISTRS FROM THE CUSTOMER WHILE YOU ARE FLYING THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO WITH THE IMMEDIATE JOB OF FLYING THE ACFT. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL LOCK OUT THE FM RADIOS TO THE TV STATION WHILE RECEIVING A CLRNC OR ATC INSTRUCTIONS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ATC TAKE PRIORITY. I AM GOING BACK TO THE BASICS -- FIRST THE ACFT AND ATC; AFTER ALL IS SET; THEN I'LL ANSWER ANY REQUEST THE NEWS STATION HAS AFTER I TURN THEM BACK ON.,,,,PLT OF B206 DESCRIBES COMS SITUATION WITH BOSTON SKYWAYS (LCL CTLR).623125,200407,1201-1800,GDM.VORTAC,MA,,,,40000,Mixed,Thunderstorm,,Daylight,,,Center ZBW.ARTCC,,Any Unknown or Unlisted Aircraft Manufacturer,,,,IFR,,,Cruise,,Class A ZBW.A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Center ZBW.ARTCC,Personal,Bombardier Learjet Undifferentiated or Other Model,,2,Part 91,IFR,Passenger,,Descent,,Class A ZBW.A,,,,,,,,,,,Facility ZBW.ARTCC,,Government,Enroute,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified; Flight Crew Private,Air Traffic Control Time Certified In Pos 1 (yrs) 18; Flight Crew Total 80,,,,623125,Aircraft X,,,Pilot Flying; Captain,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,Horizontal 6000; Vertical 1200,,Automation Air Traffic Control; Person Air Traffic Control,,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Human Factors,Human Factors,NO TEXT.,,,,ZBW CTLR EXPERIENCED OPERROR AT FL400.623265,200407,1201-1800,MVY.VOR,MA,260,30,,17000,IMC,,,Daylight,,,Center ZBW.ARTCC,Personal,PA-31T Cheyenne I,,1,Part 91,IFR,,,Cruise,,Class E ZBW.E,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Center ZBW.ARTCC,Personal,PA-31T Cheyenne I,,2,Part 91,IFR,,,Descent,,Class E ZBW.E,,,,,,,,,,,Facility ZBW.ARTCC,,Government,Enroute,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified,Air Traffic Control Radar 15,,,,623265,Facility ZBW.ARTCC,,Government,Handoff / Assist,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified,Air Traffic Control Time Certified In Pos 1 (yrs) 16,,,,623263,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Inflight Event / Encounter Weather / Turbulence; Inflight Event / Encounter Other / Unknown,Horizontal 9720; Vertical 400,,Automation Air Traffic Control; Automation Aircraft TA; Person Air Traffic Control; Person Other Person,,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Airspace Structure; Human Factors; Weather,Human Factors,THE SECTOR WAS SATURATED WITH TFC.

I EXPECTED TO CIRCLE TO THE R (E) OVER AN UNPOPULATED AREA. MY REQUEST FOR THE APCH ADDED ABOUT 15 MINS OF VECTORING TO THE FLT. I WAS XFERRED TO NORWOOD TWR OUTSIDE THE MARKER (STOGE) AND CALLED IN; THEN CALLED MARKER INBOUND. I WAS ADVISED BY NORWOOD TWR TO BREAK OFF THE APCH 3 MI FROM THE ARPT AND TRANSITION TO A L (W) DOWNWIND. THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING AS IT WOULD NEGATE THE DESIRED LESSON. I DETERMINED TO ONLY LET DOWN TO 1000 FT AND THEN BREAK OFF THE APCH AND COMPLY. THE TWR DID NOT ADVISE ME OF ANY CONFLICT; AND WHILE TWR HAD COMS WITH ANOTHER ACFT; MY CALL SIGN WAS NOT USED AND I WAS FOCUSED ON FLYING THE APCH PRECISELY. I HAD BEEN FLYING FOR 6 HRS THAT DAY; AND THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MY NOT PAYING ATTN TO THE TWR XMISSION TO THE OTHER ACFT; WHICH APPARENTLY WAS CLRNC TO TAKE OFF. WHEN I REACHED 1000 FT; AT WHAT I BELIEVED WAS ABOUT 3 MI OUT; I LOOKED UP AND SAW A LNDG LIGHT LIFTING OFF FROM RWY 17 IN MY DIRECTION; HEADED FOR MY POS. I WAS SURPRISED A DEP WAS COMING MY WAY; AND WAS MORE SURPRISED WHEN THE DEP TURNED ABOUT 20 DEGS W; THE DIRECTION TWR HAD TOLD ME TO TURN TO BREAK OFF THE APCH. IT WAS DUSK; I HAD ALREADY HAD MY STROBES AND LNDG LIGHT SWITCHED ON; AND I DETERMINED TO GO INTO A 'SEE AND AVOID' MODE RATHER THAN FOLLOW THE TWR INSTRUCTIONS AND ALLOW A CONVERGING CONFLICT SIT TO OCCUR. I DSNDED 200 FT TO ALLOW MORE SPACING AND CONTINUED IN TOWARD THE RWY 35 UNTIL THE OTHER ACFT CLRED TO MY L. THE TWR CTLR STRONGLY; AND REPEATEDLY; ADMONISHED ME FOR NOT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE TO EXPLAIN MY ACTIONS ON THE RADIO; AND TRANSITIONED W TO MAKE R TFC ABOUT 1 MI PRIOR TO THE ARPT AND LANDED. I BELIEVE THE SIT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF BETTER COMS HAD TAKEN PLACE; SPECIFICALLY IF TWR HAD ADVISED MY CALL SIGN THAT THE TRANSITION WAS TO AVOID DEPARTING ONCOMING TFC; OR IF THE DEP HAD BEEN DELAYED FOR ABOUT A MIN WHILE I WAS ALLOWED TO CONDUCT THE APCH AS REQUESTED.

THE CTLR IS NEW TO THE AGENCY WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS ATC EXPERIENCE. I WAS AT THE BOSOX SECTOR POS 47 RA; THE RADAR ASSOCIATE POS. THE RADAR CTLR APPEARED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO TFC; HOWEVER; THEIR OPERATIONAL APPLICATION HAD INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MODIFIED AND RESCINDED CLRNCS NECESSARY TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION BTWN TFC WITHIN THEIR AREA OF JURISDICTION; THESE MODIFIED CLRNCS INDICATED A LACK OF TFC AWARENESS AND PREPLANNING. THE 2 ACFT PROMPTING THIS RPT WERE BOSTON DEPS BEING HANDLED NORMALLY BY BOSTON DEP CTL (NOW BCT; BOSTON CONSOLIDATED TRACON). AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT MY ATTN AS AN ASSOCIATE CTLR HAD BEEN ON AN A320 ENRTE TO JFK VIA AN AMENDED ROUTING THAT PLACED THE ACFT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC SITS WITH VARIOUS SECTOR TFC FLOWS; AS WELL AS; REQUIRING OBSERVATION AND COORD WITH THE SECTOR ABOVE BOSOX FOR SEQUENCING WITH OTHER JFK TFC. PLANNING THE A320 SEQUENCING REQUIRED THAT I MOMENTARILY STAND AND OBSERVE POS R46 (BOSTON); A SECTOR TO OUR R; AND PHYSICALLY LOOK AT THEIR TFC; SINCE ASKING THE 47 RADAR CTLR TO QUICK LOOK POS 46 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DISTRACTING AT THAT MOMENT; AND SECTOR 46 WAS TOO BUSY TO DISCUSS OR VIEW THE A320'S PRESENT POS AND PROJECTED COURSE. SECTOR 47 RECEIVED A VOICE CALL FROM BOSTON DEP ASKING 'ARE YOU ALRIGHT WITH THOSE TWO?' (OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT); MY ATTN WAS THEN REDIRECTED TO THE TFC W OF BOSTON AT POS R47. THE 2 ACFT PROMPTING THIS RPT; AN ACR Y AND ACR Z WERE W OF BOSTON IN RELATIVE CLOSE VERT PROX WITH APPROX 5 NM SEPARATION WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN OVERTAKING SIT FROM BEHIND (THE SECTION IN WHICH THE 2 ACFT WERE LOCATED IS SINGLE-SITE ADAPTED; THEREFORE; 3 NM SEPARATION IS THE MINIMUM WHEN ACFT ARE WAKE-TURB COMPATIBLE). I DIRECTED THE RADAR CTLR'S ATTN TO THE SIT; THE RADAR CTLR THEN ISSUED INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE VAGUE; CONFUSING AND INEFFECTIVE; THE PLT OF ACR Z ACFT QUESTIONED THE CLRNC AND APPEARED TO QUESTION THE PROX OF THE TFC ADVISED BY THE RADAR CTLR TO WHICH IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR ME TO INTERVENE AND INSTRUCT THE RADAR CTLR TO TELL ACR Y TO 'STOP CLB.' THE OEDP APPARENTLY DETECTED LESS THAN 5 NM BTWN THE SUBJECT ACFT; THOUGH MY OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT AT NO TIME DID SEPARATION DIMINISH TO LESS THAN 3 NM. REGRETTABLY; THE OBSERVED PERFORMANCE OF RECENTLY CERTIFIED PERSONNEL IS ALL TOO SIMILAR TO THIS EVENT. ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THIS NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR HAS REQUIRED THE OVERSIGHT AND INTERVENTION OF OTHER CTLRS TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION WAS MAINTAINED; IN ADDITION; CRITICAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS ROUTINE HOLDING AND METERING HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLEX FOR THE CTLR TO HANDLE RESULTING IN DISORGANIZED AND DANGEROUS TFC SITS. ANOTHER NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR IN THE SAME AREA OF SPECIALTY HAS HAD ONE OPERROR AS A RESULT OF CTLR ERROR; AND HAS ALSO REQUIRED THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND SEPARATION DURING ROUTINE TFC SITS. TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE BECOMING LESS EFFECTIVE WHEN TIME-FRAMES FOR FAMILIARIZATION AND INSTRUCTION ARE SHORTENED; AS-WELL-AS; ENRTE FACILITY STAFFING LEVELS ARE DROPPING AS PERSONNEL RETIRE; THIS APPEARS TO BE PRESSURING CERTIFYING PERSONNEL TO RESTAFF THE FACILITIES ON AN ACCELERATED TIME SCHEDULE AT THE COST OF EFFECTIVE TRAINING AND FULLY CERTIFIED CTLRS.,,,,ZBW CTLR EXPRESSED CONCERN REGARDING TRAINING; EXPERIENCE AND COMPETENCE OF FELLOW CTLRS AND RECOUNTS EXAMPLE.631234,200409,0601-1200,BOS.VORTAC,MA,40,15,,9500,IMC,Rain; Turbulence; 8,,Daylight,400,,TRACON A90.TRACON,Air Carrier,Beech 1900,,2,Part 121,IFR,Passenger,,Climb,Vectors,Class E A90.E,,,,,,,,,,,Transponder,,Y,,,,Any Unknown or Unlisted Aircraft Manufacturer,,,,IFR,,,Cruise,,Class E A90.E,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,,Air Carrier,Pilot Not Flying; Captain,Flight Crew Flight Instructor; Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP); Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Multiengine,Flight Crew Last 90 Days 280; Flight Crew Total 2900; Flight Crew Type 1700,,,,631234,Aircraft X,,Air Carrier,Pilot Flying; First Officer,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,Horizontal 1000; Vertical 0,,Automation Aircraft RA; Person Flight Crew,,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Human Factors; Incorrect / Not Installed / Unavailable Part,Human Factors,ACR X DEPARTED BOS RWY 4L.

FROM ABOUT 5000 FT; WE WERE IN MODERATE TURB; SO WE WERE CLBING AT 160 KIAS AND GETTING ABOUT 2000+ FPM. CLBING THROUGH ABOUT 9500 FT; THE FOLLOWING OCCURRED: APCH CTLR (NORMAL VOICE): 'ACR X; DSND AND MAINTAIN 8000 FT.' I THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE CTLR INCORRECTLY; SINCE THE CALL DID NOT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AND IT WAS SAID IN A NORMAL TONE OF VOICE. NO MENTION OF 'TFC' OR 'TFC ALERT' ON THE CTLR'S PART. CAPT SAID: 'WAS THAT FOR ACR X?' APCH CTLR (PANICKED URGENT VOICE): 'ACR X; DSND TO 8000 FT ! DSND NOW! DSND NOW!' I IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE YOKE; PITCHED DOWN 20 DEGS; PULLED THE PWR TO IDLE AND SAID 'MY CTLS;' TAKING THE ACFT FROM FO (HE HAD STARTED THE DSCNT MANEUVER; BUT NOT AS RADICALLY AS I THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE). THOUGH THE CTLR HAD NOT ONCE SAID THE WORD 'TFC;' I GLANCED AT THE TCASII IMMEDIATELY AFTER I HAD ESTABLISHED THE DIVE AND THERE WAS A TARGET OVERLAPPING WITH OUR ACFT AT THE SAME ALT (00 INDICATED AS ALT DIFFERENCE). WE WERE IN A 4000+ FPM DSCNT AND I WAS PRAYING WE WOULDN'T COLLIDE WITH THE OTHER ACFT; WHO I DETERMINED ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER (WHEN THE TCASII WAS SHOWING ABOUT 1000 FT OF VERT SEPARATION) WAS LEVEL AT 10000 FT ON AN IFR FLT PLAN. WE WERE IMC IN HVY RAIN AND MODERATE TURB; AND WE NEVER SAW THE OTHER ACFT. I WOULD ESTIMATE THERE WAS NO VERT SEPARATION AND HORIZ SEPARATION OF LESS THAN 1/4 MI. ACR X DOES NOT HAVE TCASII; AND THE TCASI NEVER SAID 'TFC; TFC' OR ANYTHING ELSE. THE UNIT TESTED OK DURING FIRST FLT CHKS AND SUBSEQUENT TESTS AFTER THE EVENT. DURING THE TIME THAT WE INITIATED OUR DSCNT UNTIL WE WERE LEVEL AT 8000 FT; THE FREQ WAS ABSOLUTELY SILENT. THE NEXT RADIO CALL WAS FROM A DIFFERENT APCH CTLR WHO HAD IMMEDIATELY STEPPED IN TO RELIEVE THE CTLR WHO HAD GIVEN US THE CLB TO 7000 FT AND 14000 FT AND ORDERED US TO DSND. THE NEW CTLR SUBSEQUENTLY CLBED US TO 14000 FT AND HANDED US OFF TO ZBW ON FREQ 128.2. WE WERE NOT WITH CTR FOR 5 MINS WHEN THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION OCCURRED: BOSTON CTR: 'ACR Y; BOSTON TRACON WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU GET ON THE GND.' ME: 'I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO THEM; TOO; DO YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER?' THIS NEAR COLLISION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY REQUIRING ALL PART 121 CARRIERS TO HAVE TCASII. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD; I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A 'MONITOR VERT SPD' OR A 'DSND; DSND' COMMAND SHORTLY AFTER PASSING 8000 FT. BECAUSE THE ACFT ONLY HAD TCASI; THERE WAS NO COMMAND GIVEN. ADDITIONALLY; THE INSTALLED TCAS UNIT FAILED TO EVEN CALL 'TFC; 'TFC' EVEN THOUGHT IT PASSED THE SELF-TEST BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT.

ON CALLING THE PLT A 3RD TIME HE RESPONDED. POINTED OUT THE TFC TO THE C130 AND HE ADVISED THE TFC IN SIGHT. WHAT CAUSED THE PROB. A COORDINATOR POS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STAFFED. SHORT STAFFING HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. THERE WERE 6 DISTRS INVOLVED IN THIS TIME FRAME THAT TOOK MY ATTN AWAY FROM MONITORING TFC. THESE INCLUDED LANDLINE QUESTIONS; A MISTAG BY ANOTHER FACILITY; A FLT OF 2 CONFLICTING WITH EACH OTHER; PLT MISSING CORRECT SQUAWK AND PLT MISSING; QUESTIONING ASSIGNED ALT.

THE FLYING PLT WAS DISTRACTED BY THE AUTOPLT CTL PANEL AND WAS HAVING ALT EXCURSIONS OF +0/-220 FT. DURING THIS TIME; I WAS LOOKING FOR TA TFC; COACHING THE PF AND ANSWERING ATC'S TFC ADVISORIES AND VECTORS. I FINALLY HAD TO FIRMLY COMMAND THE PF TO 'FLY THE ---- AIRPLANE!;' BEFORE THE PF TOOK APPROPRIATE ACTION. IN HINDSIGHT; I SHOULD HAVE PHYSICALLY TAKEN CTL OF MY FLT SOONER INSTEAD OF COACHING. THIS FLT'S INCIDENT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A DANGEROUS TREND THAT I HAVE NOTICED WITH EXPERIENCED PLTS FLYING MULTIPLE TYPES. IT IS EASY TO BECOME DISTRACTED TRYING TO FIND SWITCHES ON THE CTL WHEEL OR AUTOPLT CTL PANEL. FOR EXAMPLE; ON ONE ACFT; THE TOUCH WHEEL CTL STEERING SWITCH IS IN THE SAME PLACE AS THE PTT ON ANOTHER ACFT; WHICH IS THE FD COMMAND BAR SYNCH ON A THIRD ACFT. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THE INDUSTRY MUST STANDARDIZE ALL CTL WHEEL SWITCHES! USING DIFFERENT COLORS IS NOT ENOUGH! DIFFERENT SHAPE SWITCHES NEED TO BE USED. THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE YEARS AGO WITH PROP/MIXTURE/THROTTLE/LNDG GEAR/FLAP CTLS. THAT WAY THE PLT HAS INSTANT TACTILE FEEDBACK ON PROPER SWITCH ACTIVATION.

RADAR DATA SAYS 500 FT AND 1/10 MILE CLOSEST POINT. MD83 SAID IT WAS THE CLOSEST THING HE EVER SAW AND HE FLEW MANY HIGH SPD MIL MISSIONS. HE FILED AN NMAC RPT AND SOUNDED SHAKEN UP. HE MISTAKENLY MADE A 160 DEG R TURN AFTER THE INCIDENT APPARENTLY DUE TO HIS RESPONSE TO THE EVENT (STRESS/CONFUSION). ALL THIS HAPPENED AT NIGHT; VFR CONDITIONS; AND EXCELLENT VISIBILITY.

AFTER RETURNING TO BTV I CONTACTED ZBW AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE LOSS OF SEPARATION WAS THE FAULT OF THE CAPE APCH/DEP CTLR WHO 'LOST TRACK' OF THE SITUATION. HE WAS CTLING ACFT Y OVERFLT FROM ACK TO LGA. HE PREMATURELY CLBED US TO 10000 FT AND MADE THE HDOF TO BOS WITHOUT PROPERLY ASSESSING THE CONFLICT POSSIBILITY.

ALSO THERE WAS A VERY HVY TFC SITUATION IN PROGRESS AND THE PRIMARY TARGET MAY HAVE BEEN COMBINED WITH OTHER TFC ABOVE OR BELOW.

I ASKED MY FO TO TURN OFF THE COCKPIT AUX HEATER; AS IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY. HE APPARENTLY MISTAKENLY TURNED OFF THE 'CABIN AIR' SWITCH RATHER THAN THE COCKPIT AUX HEATER. IN LEAR JETS; THE 'CABIN AIR' SWITCH IS THE MASTER CTL SWITCH FOR THE PRESSURIZATION SYS. UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS; IT ALLOWS ENG BLEED AIR INTO THE PRESSURIZATION SYS TO CTL THE CABIN PRESSURE OF THE ACFT IN NORMAL OP. WITH THE CABIN AIR SWITCH 'OFF;' ENG BLEED AIR IS NOT ALLOWED TO PRESSURIZE THE CABIN AND NORMAL PRESSURIZATION IS LOST. THE RESULT OF THE FO'S INADVERTENT DEACTIVATION OF THE 'CABIN AIR' SYS WAS TO DEPRESSURIZE OUR CABIN. THE OUTFLOW VALVES WOULD CLOSE TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE EXISTING PRESSURE BUT THIS WOULD BE; AND WAS; ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX. AS NO NEW BLEED AIR WAS ALLOWED TO PRESSURIZE THE ACFT; PRESSURIZATION GRADUALLY LEAKED OUT AND OUR CABIN ALT ROSE TO ABOVE 10000 FT. ABOVE 10000 FT A NUMBER OF THINGS OCCUR. FIRST A CABIN ALT WARNING SOUNDS (AND ILLUMINATES A CAUTION ADVISORY) AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE PRESSURIZATION SYS ATTEMPTS TO CTL THE CABIN ALT BY SWITCHING INTO AN EMER MODE. IN THIS MODE; THE BLEED VALVES TRIP OPEN AND HOT; UNMODULATED; HIGH PRESSURE AIR IS PUMPED DIRECTLY INTO THE CABIN. THIS STOPS PRESSURE LOSS; BUT IS VERY NOISY AND QUITE HOT. THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AURAL WARNING (UNSILENCEABLE) WAS ALSO CONTINUING TO SOUND MAKING COMS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. (THE COMBINATION OF AURAL WARNING AND HIGH PRESSURE AIR RUSHING INTO THE COCKPIT IS DEAFENING.) AT THIS POINT; I ELECTED TO BEGIN A DSCNT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ASSOCIATED EMER PROC. I ADVISED ATC THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING PRESSURIZATION PROBS AND NEEDED TO DSND TO BELOW 10000 FT. DUE TO THE NOISE IN THE COCKPIT; I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR ATC'S RESPONSE. WE HAD ONLY DSNDED A FEW FT WHEN I NOTICED A TCAS TARGET IN FRONT OF AND BELOW OUR ACFT. I OBTAINED A VISUAL ON THE TFC (A B757) WHICH WAS XING R TO L AND BELOW OUR ACFT. I IMMEDIATELY LEVELED OFF AND TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE R TO INCREASE THE OFFSET. OUR TCAS ONLY SHOWED THE POS AND ALT OF THE B757 AND ITS STATUS NEVER ELEVATED TO AN ALERT OR RA. AFTER THE B757 WAS WELL CLR TO OUR L; I CONTINUED THE DSCNT TO 8500 FT WHERE I WAS ABLE TO RESET THE EMER AIR TRIP AND REGAIN CTL OF THE ACFT PRESSURIZATION.

WE WERE CLBING THROUGH 4000 FT; I WANTED TO SEE IF THE PIC WOULD CATCH HIS INADVERTENT MISTAKE. WE WERE CLBING IN THE HOLD AND GIVEN NEW INSTRUCTIONS: 'CONTINUE THE HOLD; FLY OUTBOUND ON THE 190 DEG RADIAL.'

THE CTLR'S TONE WAS ANXIOUS. THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANY RESPONSE ASIDE FROM 'ROGER.' ATC TOOK US SBOUND FOR A WHILE BEFORE TURNING US E TOWARD 'NEETS' INTXN AND RKD; OUR DEST. FACTORS: 1) HAVING A NON-INTEGRATED AUTOPLT ADDS AN EXTRA BURDEN TO THE PLT DURING A COUPLED INST APCHS. 2) CLEARER DISTINCTION WITHIN THE CREW ON SAFETY PLT/CHK PLT/INSTRUCTOR PLT ROLE.

We were cleared for visual approach to Runway 24 MVY. Checked in with MVY Tower and cleared for left downwind to Runway 24. I descended to pattern altitude (1500msl) and entered the left downwind. Tower instructed us to extend our downwind for landing traffic/departure and told us the tower would call our base turn. As we continued on the downwind I observed an aircraft slightly higher than our altitude and between us and the extended centerline of MVY Runway 24 just past the shoreline (about 4 to 5 miles from MVY). The aircraft was flying erratically and there was no TCAS target. A white biplane was observed spinning down to our altitude and was near to abeam of our position when tower called our base turn. By that time the biplane was beginning a loop. I refused the turn from tower and continued downwind until I was sure to be clear of the aerobatic traffic. We then turned base to final with no incident. When I advised tower of the incident the reply was (he; the biplane is not in my airspace).Tower should not extend traffic into airspace they are not going to be responsible for. Aerobatic activities should be NOTAM'ed. I asked a few questions after my Passenger told me several biplanes operated commercially in the area. I was told there are two biplanes operating out of a field near MVY; one of which matched the aircraft I observed. The biplane operators should not operate near active runway approach paths. If commercial aerobatic operations are going on; how about designating a box for aerobatic operations like found anywhere else there are regular aerobatic ops like St. Augustine; FL. If the aircraft had his transponder on we might have had more warning of his proximity and I am sure if his transponder was on we would have got an RA. That might be why his transponder was off. I don't know if it is common practice to kill your squawk while doing aerobatics but I would recommend leaving it on. Tower did not seem to be concerned; MVY FBO personnel were familiar with the aerobatic operations.,,,,LR60 Captain on extended left downwind at MVY reports conflict with aircraft doing aerobatics the Tower reported the traffic was not in MVY airspace.853915,200909,0601-1200,BOS.Airport,MA,283,2.5,,1500,VMC,20,,Daylight,,,Tower BOS,Air Taxi,Kiowa/Kiowa Warrior/Combat Scout,,1,Part 135,None,Photo Shoot,,Other Orbit,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Taxi,Captain,Flight Crew Commercial; Flight Crew Flight Instructor; Flight Crew Instrument,Flight Crew Last 90 Days 165; Flight Crew Total 12000; Flight Crew Type 10000,,,,853915,Facility BOS.Tower,,Government,Local,,,,,,,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Other / Unknown,,,Person Air Traffic Control,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Exited Penetrated Airspace,Human Factors,Human Factors,I was flying a helicopter for video work in the Boston area. Initially; we transited the Class B south of the airspace. Then transited back from the south to the north for some more work; just outside to the Bravo on the north side. I told the Tower; although outside of the airspace we would continue to monitor with them. After completing that work; the customer asked us to video tape some activity at the state house; which borders the Boston Common. I called the Tower; requested clearance back into the Bravo for that destination. I was then cleared to do so. I then requested to operate at 1;500 FT. The normal altitude is 1;000. I was also cleared for this. Approximately 2 miles west of our destination; I called the Tower and requested to hold between the Boston Common and the 8 DME to the west for noise abatement; while we were waiting for the event to start. I was cleared for that request. Upon reaching the Boston Common; I started to make a 180 degree turn back to the west and head for the 8 DME. The controller then pointed out traffic departing Logan. While I was looking for the traffic the Controller questioned where I was working; which was well inside the boundaries that I had requested and was cleared for. He said that I could not be off the departure end of the runway at that altitude and must descend to 800 FT. After clearing beneath me; I started a descent to 800 FT. I then questioned the controller about the altitude. I thought I may have missed something in the earlier clearance. But I am 99% sure that I did not. We work regularly at the altitude of 1;500 over the Boston Common with 27 and 33 departures. The only thing that I can think of is that the controller was not familiar with the site picture from the Tower. And again the Controller was working two frequencies at the same time. Looking back; as busy as he was; I am not sure he was completely aware of what he was clearing me for. To help this situation; I feel that the Controller should have taken a minute to clarify in his own mind what I was going to do and if not; question it before we got there. Also; when there is the slightest doubt that the controller is not understanding what he is clearing me for; I will reconfirm the clearance with them; no matter how often and normal a particular request is.,,,,Helicopter pilot requests clearance into BOS Class B airspace over the downtown area at 1;500 FT which is granted by the Tower.

I issued an immediate climb to 3000 and a right turn heading 360.  I issued traffic; 12 o'clock; 5 miles same altitude; opposite direction; indicating VFR.  The collision alert sounded.  The aircraft involved were separated by approximately 3 miles; the VFR target indicating 2000; Aircraft X indicating 2100.  Target beacon; primary returns merged.

Once separation was increasing; I descended Aircraft X to 2000 and issued a left turn heading 340 for the VOR Runway 06 approach.  Aircraft X called the facility and requested to speak to me.  He was upset that; given the vicinity of the situation and the prevailing weather conditions; the conflicting aircraft was attempting to operate under VFR.  I explained that both his departure airport; as well as the ultimate destination airport were reporting VFR condition.

He was instructed to hold short of Taxiway E on Taxiway C. He was unable to stop short of Taxiway E and turned right onto E and continued to taxi to the ramp.

In reviewing my actions; I should have used the autopilot while sorting out the GPS loading and activation problem.,,Marginal IFR conditions in the local area. 2 aircraft inbound to CQX; the first requesting the NDB-A approach; the second a low wing fixed gear aircraft requesting the GPS-B. With traffic inbound to a HYA on the ILS 24; the first aircraft inbound to CQX was issued vectors to avoid the conflicting HYA traffic. The low wing fixed gear aircraft was issued a 360 heading; and was advised earlier that he was number two for CQX and he could slow down if he wanted. An air carrier was inbound to HYA for the ILS 24; and was gaining on the low wing fixed gear aircraft. I instructed low wing fixed gear aircraft to proceed direct to PPICE. He said he would have to find it first; this surprised me as I would have thought the pilot would have the approach plate at the ready. I asked the pilot to confirm he was requesting the GPS-B; to which he replied affirmative. After what seemed to be a long time the low wing fixed gear aircraft advised that he had found PPICE. I told the low wing fixed gear aircraft to proceed direct to PPICE; this should have put the aircraft on an estimated 040 heading. After scanning the rest of my traffic; I noticed the low wing fixed gear aircraft heading northwest bound. I turned the air carrier right heading 140 and called traffic. I then descended the air carrier and climbed single engine. For myself; next time I will climb the second CQX traffic to a higher available altitude; if available. Having many regional airports in our airspace we seem to be seeing more pilot deviations due to pilots not being completely in control of their aircraft due to unfamiliarity with the use of auto-pilot/flight management systems in small aircraft. It seems pilots are trying to comply with ATC instructions by imputing them into the planes FMS; thus exposing lack of competence in this area. I do not know what training is required by the FAA to operate these systems; but it appears to need some sort of review.,,A K90 Controller and a pilot inbound for CQX reported that the pilot had difficulty locating a waypoint on the GPS-B approach after he had already requested the approach.

I called HYA FCT and asked to turn the aircraft back toward MVY as the heading would put the aircraft in conflict with traffic at FMH unless he was given a climb. HYA advised 'no you can't turn him I have a jet departing shortly going over SEY' which the tower Controller must have thought to be a 240 heading. For some reason the Tower Controller ignored the fact that the first fix was COSSY which is approximately a 270 heading. Normally departures are assigned a heading that will enable the Radar Controller to expedite the individual departure on course. I advised the Tower Controller he may want to call before over to the Departure Controller before getting 'too creative' with vectors. Controller seemed to take offense to this and made some snide comment about using RADAR.  This is not the first time we have had a problem with HYA FCT using headings for departures that create problems of various degrees for pilots and controllers. In a recent event HYA FCT turned both IFR and VFR departures toward a TFR over FMH. Only the quick reaction of the Departure Controller kept the aircraft away from the TFR. I continue to recommend either limiting HYA FCT to one heading for each runway; allowing the RADAR Controller to take immediate control of departures; or K90 designing a training syllabus for HYA FCT as they do not have one in place.,,,,A K90 Controller discussed HYA Tower Controller procedures which allow HYA departing aircraft to depart on headings that put them in conflict with a TFR; nearby airports; and other traffic.940546,201103,1801-2400,BOS.Tower,MA,,,,,,,,,,,Tower BOS,Air Carrier,A319,,2,Part 121,IFR,,,Takeoff,SID LOGAN SIX,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Facility BOS.Tower,,Government,Flight Data / Clearance Delivery,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified,,,Confusion,,940546,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Clearance; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy; Deviation - Track / Heading All Types,,,Person Air Traffic Control,,General None Reported / Taken,Procedure,Procedure,Multiple aircraft are reading back the wrong departures off all runways at Logan. We have multiple SIDS off all different runways and the fixes along the routes are named after the SIDS. When departing off Runway 33L tonight we were using a non RNAV SID. We issued the Logan Six Departure then the first fix. The first fix on the route is the name of another SID off another runway. The pilots are not saying they are on the Logan Six. They are saying they are on the PATTS Departure and the Clearance Delivery Controller has to catch this on the read back. This has created tons of work for the Clearance Delivery position; its time to stop all these departures until we can implement all the SIDS for RNAVS at one time. Managers at Boston have said this will never happen because we are mandated by the City Courts to do this for noise abatement. It's a matter of time before two aircraft collide because of this nonsense. I was getting a read back from an A319 and the Pilot said they were on the HYLND Departure when in fact they were on the Logan Six Departure.

I RADAR identified the aircraft then instructed them to turn left direct BRRRO Intersection and climb and maintain 5;000. I can not recall what the pilot read back but I recognized the aircraft turning south to the RHODE Intersection. The conflict occurred when another aircraft was in the downwind to Runway 4R at 5;000. The course to the RHODE Intersection was underlying the arrival downwind. I instructed Aircraft X to turn left to 180 and then further left to 120 with out delay. Aircraft X was on a diverging heading by the time that vertical separation was lost with the aircraft on the down wind. The confusion over the issuance and pilot acknowledgment of the RNAV departure procedures from the BOS airport will eventually evolve into a near miss situation. The strip marking and the camera used to broadcast the strip to the TRACON is either unintelligible (strip marking) or so poorly lit the entire strip is unrecognizable. Earlier in the evening another aircraft departed Runway 15R with the RNAV in the PDR portion of the strip and the pilot denied being issued the departure procedure. Prior to this event there have been a lot of issues with ZBW taking hand off's. When the RNAV departures started there was an OM at Boston Center (ZBW ) who wrote an memorandum which instructed the controllers there not to take hand off's or climb aircraft from the TRACON until a specific intersection. This was to be briefed as a good operating procedure. The RNAV SID's are designed to get aircraft higher quicker. By not taking the hand off; the aircraft are level and lower on the departure. This creates an issue for the TRACON controller by questioning if a hand off has been made but also a compression issue in most situations because of aircraft weight and performance. There is no written procedure to pass speed information so one must call the sector. There have been a few occasions when they do not answer and one is forced to switch the aircraft with out proper land line coordination. This will cause issues this summer when volume increases. The RNAV SID's also create one westbound route from Boston where we had two before. There have been instances where controllers have taken aircraft off the departure route in order to expedite the flow of traffic; not for immediate traffic situations. These instances were not premeditated or reckless behavior from the controller. In these instances TRACON management team has briefed the controller that type of flow will not be permitted and to leave the aircraft on the route as much as possible. This has led to more step climbing and speed restrictions which creates more conflicts with arriving traffic; not even considering the negative impact to the customers. This also has another impact. Aircraft not on a RNAV (Logan SID) do not have speed restrictions built on the departure for West bound flight off Runway 22. On numerous instances; there have been unforeseen overtakes during the west bound turns; which is also during the hand off to the Center. This has made for instances where the TRACON had standard separation but the Center did not. Recommendation; change intersection names so there is no confusion. Install URET to replace hand written strips and camera. Develop a ground procedure that insures all aircraft have the proper departure procedure prior to takeoff.,,,,A90 Controller gave a detailed account of a alleged unsafe condition regrading the new RNAV departure procedures from BOS; suggesting a number of enhanced operational procedures that should reduce errors.957992,201107,1201-1800,MYV.Airport,MA,,,,1600,VMC,,,Daylight,,,TRACON K90,Air Carrier,Light Transport; Low Wing; 2 Turboprop Eng,,2,Part 121,IFR,Passenger,,Initial Approach,Vectors,Class D MVY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRACON K90,Air Taxi,Commercial Fixed Wing,,1,Part 135,IFR,Passenger,,Initial Approach,Visual Approach,Class D MVY,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,Captain; Pilot Not Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),Flight Crew Last 90 Days 35; Flight Crew Total 3300; Flight Crew Type 53,,Confusion; Communication Breakdown; Situational Awareness; Time Pressure; Workload,Party1 Flight Crew; Party2 ATC; Party2 Flight Crew,957992,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,,,Automation Aircraft RA; Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Environment - Non Weather Related; Procedure; Airspace Structure,Procedure,While on a visual approach to Runway 24 at MVY; ATC had made several 'traffic calls' to us. We were paralleling course toward MVY from the southwest with another air carrier. We had been assigned 1;600 FT; which we were at. We didn't have the other aircraft insight yet; but ATC notified the other aircraft of our position. He replied that he had us insight; so they cleared him for the visual approach and told him to head 'right for the numbers.' This meant he was now turning toward us. Approach then told us to widen out and turn more northbound. Our TCAS showed his altitude as +00 from ours. I made visual contact with the air carrier aircraft at this point as he turned toward us and ATC wanted us to then turn toward him. I told the First Officer to not turn; but head toward the airport so that we don't hit the aircraft. The First Officer then got sight of the aircraft and was shocked at how close we were. Our TCAS was calling 'Traffic; traffic' more than a few times during this whole thing. The RA was received when the other aircraft turned toward us. We complied with the RA. Once the other aircraft had begun to descend we were clear of conflict and then turned northbound to enter right traffic for Runway 24. No further incidents were noted. The event occurred when Cape Approach cleared the other air carrier for a visual approach and instructed him to head for the numbers; as well as telling us to turn north. This put both aircraft on a collision course; as we were at the same altitude. The other aircraft pilot did call us insight; however; if we did not have him in sight and complied with ATC's instruction of turning northbound; we may have very well experienced a midair collision. The simple fact is ATC assigned both our aircraft and the other aircraft instructions that put us on a collision course while we were both assigned the same altitude.

I departed and; at roughly 1;100 MSL; I initiated my left turn to 250. BED Tower then gave me an immediate hand-off to Boston Approach. As I was tuning the radio to 124.4 I lowered the nose to check for traffic. I then saw a [high wing light aircraft] zip by at roughly 500 FT horizontal distance and roughly 150 to 200 FT vertical distance. The [other aircraft] didn't appear to have taken any evasive action. I did not either; as we were on nearly orthogonal courses. Neither Bedford Tower before the hand off nor Boston Approach after the hand off called any specific traffic. On my departure I never had the downwind traffic BED Tower called out in sight. I also never told them I had the traffic. They passed the traffic alert with my departure clearance while I was still on the ground holding short of Runway 29. Despite being a flight instructor; and having reminded trainees on many occasions that departing an IFR flight plan doesn't relieve the pilot of full traffic awareness when in VMC; I allowed my focus on IFR procedures during a VMC departure from an unfamiliar airport to interfere with and reduce the amount of time I spent looking out of the windows for traffic. I was focused on my vectors to the BOSOX Intersection; the hand off to Boston Approach and not enough on looking for traffic. I am glad that I lowered the nose and took a look; but overall my eyes were inside too much. Also; as I have told many trainees; the pilot workload is higher for an IFR departure in VMC because you have to do all the IFR cockpit tasks; but also all the VFR traffic avoidance tasks. I am lucky that we missed each other. This experience is a valuable personal teaching moment and one that I can use constructively with my students.,,,,A PA28 pilot reported an airborne conflict with another light aircraft on a short flight from BED to BOS.

Runway heading off of Runway 6 was agreed upon by the Developmental and the Tower; I then questioned the Tower if we could have control of the aircraft upon departure. The request was approved by the Tower. After the PA28 was RADAR identified; the Developmental turned the aircraft to a heading 310; to maneuver the aircraft for a left downwind for the ILS 6 final approach course. In the meantime; the Tower released a King Air off of Runway 6 on a heading of 010 climbing to 2;000 FT; putting the King Air and the PA28 on converging courses with the same altitude assigned. When the King Air checked in on the assigned heading of 010; I immediately took over the frequency to stop the climb of the King Air at 1;500 FT (the MVA for that area) and turned the aircraft right to a heading of 090; behind the PA28. I then called traffic to the King Air; the pilot reported the traffic in sight; and the pilot was then instructed to maintain visual separation. After the aircraft passed I climbed the King Air to 4;000 FT and then turned the aircraft on course. ACK and HYA Towers both use the ARTS rundown departure list. HYA Tower puts the assigned heading of the departing aircraft in the run down list when the aircraft is rolling. ACK Tower only puts the departure runway in the list when the aircraft is rolling; the assigned heading is unknown to the Approach Controller prior to aircraft checking in with Departure. Since the technology already exists; I recommend that ACK Tower be required to put the assigned heading in the run down list as well. If an Approach Controller notices that the heading assigned to the aircraft will put the departure in conflict with traffic; the Approach Controller can be proactive and coordinate a different heading with Tower early enough that separation errors and unsafe situations never develop. This has been brought up to ACK Tower in the past; however ACK Tower resisted the change. Doing this would not alleviate responsibility on either the Tower or Approach Controller; but would be added tool of situational awareness for the Approach Controller.,,,,K90 Controller described a near loss of separation event involving missed coordination with an ACK Tower. The reporter suggests that ACK Tower run down coordination procedures should be changed to duplicate those used by HYA Tower to simplify coordination.1025394,201207,1201-1800,BOS.Airport,MA,,,,1100,,,,,,,Tower BOS,Air Carrier,A320,,2,Part 121,IFR,Passenger,,Initial Climb; Takeoff,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tower BOS,Air Taxi,Cessna 402/402C/B379 Businessliner/Utiliner,,1,Part 135,IFR,,,Initial Climb,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,Facility BOS.Tower,,Government,Local,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified,,,Situational Awareness; Communication Breakdown,Party1 ATC; Party2 ATC,1025394,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,,,Person Air Traffic Control,,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert,Procedure; Weather; Human Factors,Human Factors,I cleared an A320 for takeoff on Runway 4R.

Almost immediately; I noticed the A320 was climbing toward a C402 that had departed Runway 4L. The C402 was climbing on the 4R extended center line area instead of tracking to the northwest as expected. The C402 had been worked by the Local Control West (LCW) Controller and had been assigned a 350 heading which was inadequate; during strong northwest wind to ensure separation between the two runways. I immediately notified the Departure Controller of the impending conflict between the two aircraft. I should have talked more with the LCW Controller about the wind and the Runway 4L departures. I should have also recognized the conflict before I had the A320 change frequencies so that I could have issued instructions to resolve the conflict.,,,,BOS Controller described a conflict event between two IFR departures from different runways; listed coordination failures and lack of intervention as causal factors.1078354,201303,1801-2400,BOS.Airport,MA,,,,1000,,,,,,,Tower BOS,,Cirrus Aircraft Undifferentiated,,,,VFR,,,Cruise,None,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Facility BOS.Tower,,Government,Traffic Management,Air Traffic Control Fully Certified,,,,,1078354,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict,,,Person Air Traffic Control,,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance,Human Factors; Procedure,Human Factors,Aircraft called asking for a city tour.

I advised aircraft of an air carrier departure just lifting off and to maintain visual separation with the air carrier. Pilot said she would do so but her actions did not indicate that she saw the aircraft. I advised pilot that the air carrier was going to turn left in compliance with the SID and for her to descend as both aircraft appeared to be at the same altitude.

We were on vectors to 27 and on downwind. We were following an airbus and a 757 in sequence. We were aware of those two aircraft and had visual on both. Weather was VFR; but getting dark. We were cleared to descend to 3;000 FT.We noticed a hit on our TCAS that was not pointed out by ATC nor made any radio transmissions that we heard. We looked for the traffic; but did not see anything. I actually thought it might have been a ghost hit. We were given a vector to a base leg. While in the turn and leveling off at 3;000 we received an RA. There was an aircraft in our path we could not see (we were looking and I now think he was climbing). We complied with the RA and received a 'clear of conflict' oral message. I immediately informed ATC that we had an RA and had to maneuver the aircraft to avoid collision. I inquired about the traffic. The Controller stated that we had plenty of clearance from the traffic. I was stunned. I felt like we were put in a very bad spot and the Controller did not have a clue. Maybe my bad for thinking a ghost target; but I still had very good SA [Situational Awareness]. We were constantly clearing outside and we were aware of the TA hit on TCAS. We did not know that aircraft's trends. We eventually were within 500 FT of the traffic. I am not saying I am perfect; however; my SA was pretty high. My concern is that we were put in a position that we should not have been put in. We were being vectored to final at one of the nation's busiest airports at night. ATC never pointed out the conflicting traffic. We had SA on hit on TCAS. Controller never said anything. After RA; Controller said 'traffic was not a factor'. I was so upset. I asked for his phone number. Captain called him last night. I could not. I was completely dumbfounded by what I heard and thought I was much too upset and angry to talk to a Controller with very low SA.

I exchanged traffic information with both aircraft. Aircraft Y began his descent. I caught the descent when Aircraft Y was leaving 10;800; and instructed the pilot to maintain 11;000. I instructed Aircraft X and Aircraft Y to maintain visual separation from each other. Both pilots read it back timely and correctly. I issued a 'Brasher' warning to Aircraft Y and asked what happened? His response was that he received a 'descend Via' clearance.In reference to all of the RNAV changes in recent months/years; I feel that all of this change is confusing to flight crews and controllers. I specifically told the crew that there was crossing traffic and issued traffic; and the crew still descended!My recommendation is to not use the word 'cleared' in a clearance associated with RNAV procedures. If we are going to use this phraseology; I recommend re-iterating to the pilot the altitude to maintain. 'Cleared KRANN3 Runway 27 Transition; maintain 11;000'.

We were given a descent to 2;000 by ATC and told to make rapid descent because of traffic. As we approached 2;000 ATC issued a heading of 030 to get around the traffic. We had not been able to make visual contact with the other aircraft.While we were still in the turn we got a 'descend' RA. We complied with the RA and advised ATC what we were doing. As we received the clear of conflict message from TCAS the flying pilot began to roll wings level. At this point; the non-flying PIC made visual contact with the aircraft. It appeared to be a single engine. [However; as] the flying pilot rolled wings level a second aircraft was in our front wind screen. The flying pilot took evasive action by descending and turning left.The second aircraft was a twin engine piston aircraft; perhaps a Cessna 402 that looked to be headed for MVY. As the flying pilot was taking action the TCAS gave RA call outs with which we complied. We were approximately 500 FT from the second aircraft at the same altitude. After this we told ATC about the second aircraft and [then] went on to land on Runway 24.,,...I can't think of any way to have avoided this situation. That is a busy airport and we were on a IFR flight plan following ATC instructions when the event happened.,,A G-IV flight crew suffered two consecutive conflicts with aircraft in the vicinity of their airport of intended landing.

The approach controller on frequency 126.5 reported traffic to our left that had us in sight and was landing on runway 4L. Although we saw a target on the TCAS to our left and below us; we were not able to locate the aircraft visually. Approach control switched us to the tower on frequency 132.22. Shortly thereafter; at approximately 3500 feet MSL; we received a TCAS Traffic Advisory (TA); then an Resolution Advisory (RA); but were still not able to see the aircraft. I initiated a climb in response to the RA and the captain reported the RA to the tower. When clear of conflict; I returned to the glideslope and a stabilized approach and continued to a landing. We never did see the aircraft.An aircraft on a visual approach to runway 4L apparently strayed into the approach corridor for runway 4R. The aircraft either did not have us in sight or did a poor job of maintaining visual separation.Approach control could possibly stagger the arrivals to the parallel runways to provide better separation even though visual separation is already in use.,,We were on the ILS 4R and advised of traffic though never saw him. While descending through 3500 FT we received a RA/Climb command we executed a climb and never saw traffic. We advised ATC; climbed about 200 FT; were 'clear of conflict' and able to re-stabilize on approach and landed without incident on 4R in Boston.I don't think the other aircraft actually ever had us in sight even though he called it. Our TCAS showed he was directly below us and not off to the left which is where he should've been.Unfortunately we can't do anything if someone reports 'traffic in sight' and may not actually see us; we did as TCAS commanded and everything turned out fine.,,ERJ-190 flight crew reported getting an RA caused by an aircraft on a visual approach on the parallel runway into BOS.1269183,201506,1201-1800,8B5.Airport,MA,,,1000,,VMC,20,,Daylight,10000,,CTAF 8B5,Personal,Cardinal 177/177RG,,1,Part 91,None,Training,,Other Simulated engine out,,Class E ZBW,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CTAF 8B5,Personal,Ultralight,,1,Part 91,,,,Initial Approach,,Class E ZBW,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Personal,Single Pilot,Flight Crew Instrument; Flight Crew Private,Flight Crew Last 90 Days 5; Flight Crew Total 858; Flight Crew Type 858,,Training / Qualification; Situational Awareness,,1269183,,,,,,,,,,,Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural FAR; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy,Horizontal 3000; Vertical 500,,Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Human Factors,Human Factors,I was working with an instructor on wings & Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC).

Spotted an airport; and entered a non-standard steep descending right base to set up for simulated engine out landing.  We were not on CTAF. We noticed a possible ultralight on high left base beginning to break off their approach.  We immediately broke off the approach to the right and climbed out of the pattern.  We then got on CTAF; but didn't hear any other traffic. The instructor didn't want me aware of the nearby airport; and was simulating an IFR emergency; breaking out of IMC; to a power off landing.  This resulted in no radio calls being made; and only one pair of eyes clearing the area prior to the simulated emergency. The radios could have been set up for CTAF frequencies in the area without necessarily informing me of the nearby airport. This would have made it easier to get onto CTAF and announce for traffic without referring to charts.  A call then could have been made as soon as I had spotted the airport as the intended point of landing.  Also if we were 'monitoring' CTAF; the instructor might have heard the traffic even though I was not aware of our position.

I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed the 'bird' over land; but it stood out against the deep blue-green of the harbor. And its wings weren't flapping. Oops. I then quickly recognized the familiar shape of a toy; it was a DJI Phantom drone. Because it was well beneath us; no avoidance maneuvering was necessary; but I called out its position to the Captain Pilot Flying (PF) and then to BOS Tower; who quickly relayed the alert to traffic following us on the approach; and who; after we landed; asked me to phone the Tower Supervisor with details; which I did. Although no maneuvering was necessary; the sighting and relaying of the drone's location clearly distracted from my other duties during one of the most critical phases of flight. I've spoken with several other Pilots who know friends and neighbors with drones; or who have purchased one for themselves or their children. I would hope they all realize that the very dense and heavy nature of the batteries on these machines are going to cause far greater damage than a bird of equivalent weight; when one finally; and it seems inevitably; impacts a windscreen; jet engine; or flap assembly. It's going to be ugly; and we really need to spread the word. So I would urge anyone reading this who operate drones; to ask them to visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org and make sure they fully understand where and when drones are appropriate. Because of its altitude; I wouldn't be surprised if the one we saw had been launched in complete innocence off a boat in the harbor; simply to take photos or videos of the boat's owners.It may to be one of the most harmless drone/aircraft encounters on record; yet it was still; if for no other reason than the distraction; a hazard to air navigation.,,,,B737 First Officer reports a drone at 800 feet AGL during approach to Runway 4R at BOS.

RWY 23 was active and Aircraft X was in the right downwind. Aircraft Y was on the right base to RWY 23. Aircraft X was instructed to make a left 360 when they were midfield. As they were rolling out of the 360 I pointed the aircraft out to the developmental. She instructed them to make another tight left 360 and they acknowledged. We did not tell Aircraft Y about Aircraft X in a 360 abeam the numbers. We did tell Aircraft X about Aircraft Y and they would be number 3 to follow. I told the trainee traffic for one is traffic for another but we never called it on frequency.We had an aircraft on short final so I scanned gear and the RWY. A helicopter was operating on the east side of the airspace. They called up to tell us they were tracking RT3 northbound and they were going to be hovering on about a 3 mile final for RWY23. As I scanned back to the northwest; Aircraft Y keyed up and said they had traffic directly ahead and inquired what they were doing. They also said they took evasive maneuvers to avoid. At this point I keyed up let Aircraft Y know the traffic was now behind them and they were cleared to land. I told Aircraft X they were #2 and cleared to land.

I also told him [not] to worry that I would walk him through it.During all these changes; we were told to look for traffic to follow. I was dividing my attention between being heads down reprogramming the FMS and looking outside at night for traffic to follow (which was the plane that would be parallel to us on a visual to RWY 4R). ATC told us to slow to 190 knots and a descent to 4;000 feet. Once we had the traffic in-sight; the controller gave us the visual approach; a turn towards the airport; told us to maintain 170 knots to 5 mile final; cross the 10 DME at or above 3;000 feet; and to contact tower at 128.8. I was trying to make all the appropriate FMS changes for intercept the course; keep the airplane on 4R in-sight; make all the configuration changes that the FO was calling for (gear; flaps; speed and altitude on the guidance panel and to draw a 10 mile ring on the moving map to identify the 10 DME/3000 feet restriction).The frequency was extremely busy since we had been with BOS Center since they were giving everyone basically S-turns because of the runway changes and with approach as they were getting saturated funneling everyone with the runway changes. As we were on the final phase of intercepting the 10 mile ring; the final controller told us that he needed us going directly to the runway. I told him that we were and that we were turning through a heading of 070 already. As we started the final descent; I told the FO to disconnect the autopilot and to hand flying it and to use the VNAV glide path as reference and that I would give him a 3 degree descent angle to cross-reference his descent.When the autopilot disconnected; we received a very loud 'autopilot' continuous disconnect aural warning. As I have been a CA/FO on this model of aircraft for many years; I knew that the continuous aural warning is related to the trim system when the autopilot is flying. We both again pressed our respective autopilot discount buttons to try to silence the warning; but it did not stop. At the same time; we received a TCAS RA with the traffic off to our right. I believe the TCAS detected that we were both descending; with a closure rate but it cannot distinguished that we were on a very closed parallel approach. I told the FO 'My aircraft' and simply called for a go around. I manually overrode the autopilot. I called for flaps 2 and gear up as I initiated a climb. The tower noticed that we were going around and called us. I simply clicked the mike and said; 'standby'. I prioritized flying with newer FO; letting catch up with what was going on as we still trying to speak to each other on a busy frequency; with a continuous loud aural warning and reconfiguring the aircraft. A few seconds later; the tower told us to turn to the left; that if able to maintain 3;000 feet and to let him know if we needed any assistance. We complied with his instructions and told him that we had an autopilot issue and we needed to run a checklist.I called for the FO to run the QRH procedure for the autopilot aural warning. The FO successfully ran the QRH and the aural message stopped. I transfer control of the aircraft back to the FO and we were vectored back around for a normal landing. I should have turned down the visual approach for a number of reasons. A very late third change of runway; flying with not a very experienced FO; at night; how close we were to the airport and the complexity of reprogramming the FMS and doing a so-close parallel approach. I have done this approach a number of times in the daytime; but cannot recall the last time I had to do it at night. ATC was trying to keep us parallel to the traffic as we both descended. I think the TCAS sense the closure rate and that was the reason for the RA.,,,,Air carrier Captain reported he received a TCAS RA while on a night visual parallel approach to Runway 4L at BOS; performed a go-around; and eventually was vectored around for a normal landing.1447690,201705,1201-1800,BOS.Airport,MA,,,,,,,,,,,TRACON A90,Air Carrier,A321,,2,Part 121,IFR,,Localizer/Glideslope/ILS Runway 04L,Final Approach,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRACON A90,Air Taxi,Large Transport,,2,Part 121,IFR,,FMS Or FMC; Localizer/Glideslope/ILS Runway 04R,Final Approach,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,Captain; Pilot Flying,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),,,Situational Awareness,,1447690,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy,,,Automation Aircraft TA; Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Issued Advisory / Alert; Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Became Reoriented; Flight Crew Took Evasive Action,Procedure; Human Factors; Airport,Ambiguous,We were told by approach control to expect an ILS to 04R. We were then told to expect a visual to 04L and given a vector to be followed by a clearance direct to Boston. We were then asked to report the airport AND traffic off to our right. There were several targets and we informed ATC that we were unable to determine which aircraft they wanted us to report. We were then issued a clearance to turn right to 090 degrees. When I initiated the turn it became very apparent which aircraft they wanted us to see because there was a [large transport aircraft] right in front of us on approach to 04R. I immediately turned the autopilot off and corrected left to avoid a collision with the jet (Aircraft Y). We received a TCAS TA at about the same time I clicked the autopilot off. That approach contained the most mishandled and dangerous clearances I have ever experienced in my entire aviation career.I called the TRACON supervisor to find out why this event occurred. He informed me that there was a trainee controller on both 04L AND 04R and they had issued us a 190 speed in error which put us out in front of Aircraft Y; which is why we didn't see him. He then issued us a 170 speed so Aircraft Y would overtake us. The problem was Aircraft Y had not overtaken us completely when he issued the heading of 090. I then asked why we were not staggered like SFO does. The supervisor informed me they do not stagger in BOS and try and put us wingtip to wingtip. That does not seem like the safest course of action to me. Do not have trainees working two parallel runways at the same time. In addition do not change runway clearances at the last minute. I would also suggest that with close together runways such as 04L and 04R in BOS that we are staggered so as never to be wingtip to wingtip in case someone overshoots the turn or maybe doesn't see the aircraft ATC wants you to see because they are behind you.,,,,A321 Captain reported a side by side approach with another large turbojet to Runways 4L and 4R that he believed was not safe but was reported as standard practice at BOS.1448778,201705,1801-2400,BOS.Airport,MA,,6,,2200,VMC,10,,Dusk,5000,,TRACON A90,Air Carrier,Medium Transport; Low Wing; 2 Turbojet Eng,,2,Part 121,IFR,Passenger,Localizer/Glideslope/ILS Runway 27,Final Approach,,Class B BOS,,,,,,,,,,,ILS/VOR,,X,Malfunctioning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aircraft X,Flight Deck,Air Carrier,Pilot Not Flying; First Officer,Flight Crew Air Transport Pilot (ATP),Flight Crew Last 90 Days 161; Flight Crew Total 3935; Flight Crew Type 298,,,,1448778,,,,,,,,,,,ATC Issue All Types; Aircraft Equipment Problem Less Severe; Conflict Airborne Conflict; Deviation - Procedural Published Material / Policy,,,Person Flight Crew,In-flight,Air Traffic Control Issued New Clearance; Flight Crew Landed As Precaution,Aircraft,Aircraft,We were setup on the ILS 27 approach into BOS. They were also landing 33L. The Final Approach controller issued us maintain 170 kts to RIPIT (FAF) during the approach we received Red X's 3 times which would indicate the Localizer isn't working on our instruments. This happened outside the FAF and we were visual and could maintain a visual with the airport that we decided that we wouldn't go around because it was VMC. We continued the Approach. Final asked what speed we were doing. I replied 170 kts. He then came back and said spacing wouldn't work and even if we slowed it wouldn't work. Cancel Approach clearance turn right 360 and maintain 2000 and that he would sequence us back. My Captain then replied over the radio 'Unable we were given red x's and we are having navigational problems.' After a few seconds the Captain then said 'we broke out we need to continue the approach' (we were already visual). Final says traffic to look out for 11 o'clock 800 ft. Captain replies traffic insight. Final says maintain a visual with the traffic cleared ILS 27. I then repeat back maintain visual and clear for the approach. Final asks if we were having issues with navigation. I reply we are visual with the airport. Final hands us off to tower. This whole exchange lasted for over 30 seconds from when he asked how fast we were going until we got the hand off to tower. We were 3.6 DME from the ILS when the other aircraft landed. The red X's appeared around 13.5 to 11.5 DME. Upon taxiing in ground had a number for the captain to call. The captain called the number and then after some time referred the guy to our chief pilot I wasn't able to hear what the whole conversation entailed I just heard what the Captain said to the person.,,,,Air carrier First Officer reported navigation problems arose on final to BOS Runway 27 and they continued to a visual landing after ATC had cancelled their approach clearance due to traffic to Runway 33L.
