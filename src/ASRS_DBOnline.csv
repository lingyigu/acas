I WAS CONDUCTING A PLT CHK FLT WITH A PVT PLT WISHING TO HAVE RENTAL PRIVILEGES AT THE FBO/FLT SCHOOL WHERE I AM A PART TIME CFI. I CAN ONLY ASSUME I WAS INVOLVED IN A MIDAIR NEAR MISS BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THE OTHER ACFT IN SIGHT. BUT; I ASSUME IT DID HAPPEN BASED ON THE STATEMENT OF THE PLT OF THE OTHER ACFT. WHILE TAXIING TO THE ACTIVE RWY I ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM WITH THE PLYMOUTH UNICOM THAT THE ACFT RADIO WAS OPERATING PROPERLY. I NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THEM TO MY REQUEST FOR A RADIO CHK. I ASSUMED THE ACFT RADIO WAS NOT TRANSMITTING BUT DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE FLT SINCE USE OF A RADIO IS NOT REQUIRED AT UNCTLED ARPTS. TO HELP PLTS SEE US BETTER; I TURNED ON THE ACFT'S NAV; STROBE AND LNDG LIGHTS AND LEFT THEM ON THROUGHOUT THE FLT. ALSO; I DID BROADCAST MY POS ANYWAY WHILE OPERATING IN THE TFC PATTERN. DURING THE THIRD LNDG WE TURNED; AND AFTER BEING ESTABLISHED ON A BASE LEG I HEARD THE PLT OF AN SMA Y BROADCAST HE WAS ALSO ON BASE. I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HIM. ONCE MY ACFT WAS ON FINAL; A FEW SECS LATER; I HEARD HIM BROADCAST THAT HE WAS GOING AROUND. AT THIS POINT I STILL DID NOT SEE SMA Y AND PROCEEDED WITH THE LNDG. ONCE ON THE RAMP AND AFTER HE SHUT DOWN; HE CAME OVER TO ME AND EXPLAINED HOW CLOSE WE HAD COME. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I SHOT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. SINCE WE WERE BOTH FLYING LOW WINGED ACFT; I CAN ONLY COME UP WITH ONE EXPLANATION. IF I WAS UNDER AND BEHIND HIM; I WOULD HAVE HAD TO SEE HIM. MY EXPLANATION IS THAT WE WERE ALREADY ON FINAL AND PROCEEDING TOWARD THE RWY AT ABOUT 70 KTS; THE FINAL APCH SPD OF SMA Y IS 63 KTS. THE SMA X WITH AN APCH SPD RECOMMENDED BY ACFT MFTR IS 75 KTS; WAS TURNING BASE TO FINAL. OUR SPD TOWARD THE RWY WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM LIKE WE OVERTOOK THE ACFT; BUT AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. FORTUNATELY NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED. SINCE MY ACFT WAS UNDER THE SMA Y AND ON FINAL WE HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY. THE PLT OF THE SMA Y RPTED A NMAC RPT WITH THE NE FSDO OFFICE. SINCE I WAS IN THE RIGHT SEAT; THE BASE TO FINAL TURN WOULD HAVE POSITIONED THE ROOF OF THE SMA X TO BLOCK ANY TFC ABOVE US. OUR APCH SPDS WERE APPROX 70 KTS OR LOWER; SINCE I INSIST ON THIS WITH STUDENTS AND WAS PAYING PARTICULAR ATTN TO HOW THE PVT PLT I WAS CHKING WAS HANDLING THE ACFT.

THERE WAS NO PWR TO ANY DASH INSTRUMENT INCLUDING GEAR LOCK INDICATIONS. THE ENG APPEARED TO BE OPERATING AT FULL PWR; BUT THE MASTER SWITCH FUSED (WELDED?) BEHIND THE PANEL AND COULD NOT BE MOVED. I MADE THE LEFT TURN TO THE LEFT DOWNWIND AS PREVIOUSLY CLRED AND BEGAN ROCKING THE WINGS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ATTRACT THE ATTN OF TWR PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A LIGHT GUN LNDG CLRNC.

I SAID WE WERE 2 MI ON FINAL (I TRIED TO KEEP XMISSIONS AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE CONGESTION ON THE FREQ). I HEARD TWR CLEAR TFC TO BACK TAXI INTO POSITION AND HOLD RWY 29. 12) TWR ASKED IF WE WERE ON FINAL FOR RWY 24. I SAID NO; WE ARE SHORT FINAL FOR RWY 11. AFTER SEEING TFC PULL OUT ONTO RWY FROM THE LEFT AT ALPHA TXWY I ADVISED F/O TO PREPARE TO GO AROUND.

WE WERE AT ABOUT 1/2 MI FINAL 500-400' DESCENDING. I SAID GO AROUND AND TURN RIGHT WE HAVE HEAD ON TFC. HE APPLIED FULL POWER AND CALLED FOR FLAPS TEN. I RETRACTED THE FLAPS AND PUT THE GEAR UP. THEN I GRABBED THE YOKE AND TURNED ACFT TO THE LEFT TO AVOID HITTING AN SMA Y. THAT WAS AT THE DEP END OF RWY 24; ABOUT OVER THE NUMBERS; AND 300-400' CLIMBING. F/O DID NOT SEE HIM; F/O POINTED OUT TFC THAT APPEARED TO BE PARALLELING RWY 11 ON RIGHT DOWNWIND SLIGHTLY ABOVE US HDG NWBND. I SAW HIM THEN OBSERVED TFC AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK POSITION. HE WAS ON CLOSE DOWNWIND FOR RWY 24L TFC. I TURNED ACFT TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID HITTING HIM. 13) TWR TOLD US TO FOLLOW THE HIGH WING ACFT THAT WAS MID DOWNWIND LEFT TFC FOR RWY 24. WE ACKNOWLEDGED. WE PASSED BEHIND THAT TFC; CLIMBED UP TO 1500' AND ENTERED DOWNWIND. WE LOST SIGHT OF OUR TFC THAT WAS NOT BEHIND US. WE TURNED BASE ABOUT 3 MI OUT AND LANDED ON RWY 24. 14) AFTER LNDG I ASKED GND CTL IF THERE WAS A SUPVR ON DUTY. GND CTL SAID THAT WAS THE SUPVR.

I THOUGHT THE HELI WAS INBND VFR. TRACON SOON HANDED OFF THE HELI BY ARTS (AT 2000') AND I ACCEPTED THE HDOF. I ISSUED A TCA CLRNC AND ASKED CPR X TO START A DSND; AND REITERATED IT WAS A VFR DSNT.

I THEN COORDINATED WITH THE DEP CTLR TO TURN ACR Y BACK TO 220 DEGS OR 180 DEGS TO PROVIDE LAT SEP. CPR X THEN SAID HE COULD DSND. I GAVE THE DSNT AND ISSUED ACR Y AS TFC; ASSUMING ACR Y WAS TURNING SBND AWAY FROM CPR X. (THE TAPES SHOWED THE DEP CTLR NEVER ISSUED ACR Y A TURN BACK TO 200 OR 180 DEGS.)

NOT WILLING TO ASSUME ANYTHING; I TWICE ASKED THE F/O IF WE HAD BEEN CLRED FOR THE APCH HE ASSURED ME BOTH TIMES THAT WE HAD BEEN.

AS WE WERE STOPPED ON THE STOPWAY HOLDING SHORT OF THE RWY 22R STOPWAY; WAITING CLRNC TO CROSS; I HEARD THE TWR INSTRUCT ACR Y BEHIND US TO; 'GO AROUND; ACFT ON RWY.'

MY RESPONSE WAS; 'ROGER; CPR X CLRED TO LAND 27; HOLD SHORT RWY 22R.' THE LNDG WAS ROUTINE AND WE ROLLED TO THE END AND ONTO THE STOPWAY AND STOPPED SHORT OF RWY 22R; STILL ON THE RWY; ON THE STOPWAY. IF WE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO EXIT AT SIERRA TXWY; XRAY OR ECHO TXWYS; WE WOULD HAVE DONE SO. BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE ONLY; 'TURN R AT THE END.' WE DID NOT THINK TO QUESTION THE CTLR'S INSTRUCTIONS. WE SIMPLY HELD SHORT OF RWY 22R (ACTUALLY THE 22R STOPWAY) AND WAITED FOR CLRNC TO CROSS 22R. THE RESULT WAS ACR Y BEING SENT AROUND BEHIND US BECAUSE WE WERE STILL ON THE RWY; AND A WDB ABORTING ITS TKOF BECAUSE OF THE TWR'S UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO.

WX CONDITIONS WERE VMC IN TYPICAL SUMMER HAZE RESULTING IN REDUCED VISIBILITY. WE WERE ON A VECTOR TO A L DOWNWIND LEG; ABOUT 20 MI FROM THE ARPT; AND HAD BEEN TOLD TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH ONCE THE ARPT WAS IN SIGHT. DSNDING THROUGH ABOUT 7000 FT ON A CLRNC TO 6000 (CLEAN CONFIGN; 250 KTS IAS; AUTOPLT AND AUTOTHROTTLES ENGAGED; I WAS FLYING); WE RECEIVED A TFC ADVISORY FROM THE APCH CTLR CONCERNING AN ACFT AT OUR 11 O'CLOCK POS. THE TFC WAS DESCRIBED NOT BY ITS TYPE; BUT BY ITS OPERATOR'S NAME; A NAME NEITHER OF US RECOGNIZED. THE CAPT OF OUR ACFT SAW TFC 'A' THAT POS WHICH HE TOOK TO BE THE ACFT IN QUESTION AND HE ADVISED THE CTLR ACCORDINGLY. WHILE I DID NOT SEE THE TFC; THE CAPT ADVISED ME THAT AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED ON ITS PRESENT HDG; IT WOULD NOT BE A FACTOR FOR US. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE TCAS ADVISED 'TFC TFC' AND DISPLAYED A YELLOW CIRCLE AT OUR 11 O'CLOCK POS. THE TCAS WAS ON THE 40 MI RANGE AND DISPLAYED A LARGE NUMBER OF TARGETS (WELL IN EXCESS OF TEN). THE YELLOW TARGET; ON THIS RANGE; APPEARED VERY CLOSE TO OUR POS ON THE DISPLAY; SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO BE LOST IN CLUTTER OF OTHER ACFT AND ESSENTIALLY UNINTERPRETABLE; SO I SELECTED THE 5 MI RANGE FOR A MEANINGFUL LOOK. I ANTICIPATED THAT THE TARGET WOULD BE THE NON-CONFLICTING TFC WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED OUT AND SEEN BY THE CAPT. THE CAPT CONTINUED LOOKING OUT THE WINDSHIELD FOR THE TFC. BEFORE THE SHORTER RANGE DISPLAY COULD BE FULLY PAINTED AND INTERPRETED; THE TCAS GAVE US A 'CLB CLB CLB' ADVISORY AND THE PERIMETER LIGHTS ON THE VSI INDICATOR DISPLAYED RED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE INST THROUGH ZERO AND UP TO SOME HIGH POSITIVE VERT CLB RATE; WHERE SEVERAL GREEN LIGHTS WERE DISPLAYED. MY EARLIER EXPECTATION THAT NO HAZARD EXISTED APPEARED NOW TO HAVE BEEN INCORRECT AND I RESPONDED BY ROLLING THE AUTOPLT'S VERT SPD THUMB WHEEL UP TO A HIGH RATE OF CLB. THE AUTOPLT'S SMOOTH TRANSITION FROM A 1000 FPM DSCNT TO A COMMANDED CLB IN EXCESS OF 2000 FPM WAS APPARENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE SITUATION SINCE; IN THE MIDST OF THAT VERT SPD TRANSITION; THE TCAS ADVISED 'INCREASE CLB INCREASE CLB'. I DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND HAND FLEW THE ACFT TO A HIGHER NOSE ATTITUDE. DURING THIS MANEUVER (WHICH CREATED A SLIGHT BUMP FOR THE PAXS SINCE THE PITCH TRIM HAD NOT QUITE KEPT UP WITH THE PITCH INCREASE); I SAW AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION MEDIUM SIZED TWIN PASS OFF TO OUR L SIDE AND SLIGHTLY BELOW US. I WOULD JUDGE THAT SEPARATION WAS LESS THAN HALF A MILE... PERHAPS A QUARTER OF A MI. AS IT DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW BEHIND US; THE TCAS ADVISED 'CLR OF CONFLICT'. I GENTLY TRANSITIONED FROM A HIGH CLB RATE TO A COMFORTABLE DSCNT AND RETURNED TO THE 6000 FT ALT TO WHICH WE HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY CLRED. THE CAPT ADVISED THE APCH CTLR OF THE INCIDENT AND THE CTLR REAFFIRMED THAT WE WERE CLRED TO RETURN TO 6000 FT. UPON SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CTLR; WE LEARNED THAT THE INTRUDING ACFT WAS A COMMUTER AND HAD BEEN THE TFC ORIGINALLY CALLED OUT TO US. THE TFC WE HAD SEEN HAD BEEN A SECOND TARGET (AN MLG) WHICH HAD NOT BEEN CALLED OUT.

I SHOULD MENTION SOMETHING I NOTICED WHEN I TOOK MY PLACE AT THE END OF RWY 22 FOR TKOF: THE RWY APPEARED TO HAVE A HIGH SPOT IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS LENGTH; AND THUS MADE THE FAR END OF THE RWY DIFFICULT TO SEE. WHEN I SAW BOTH THE SMA Y AND THE SMA Z TAKING OFF FROM OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE RWY; I WAS APPROX 2 MI E OF BHB.

CONCLUSIONS AND ANALYSIS: I BELIEVE THAT BDL TRACON MISJUDGED OUR VERT AND HORIZ FLT PATH. HIS EXPECTATION WAS THAT WE WOULD HAVE PASSED OVERHEAD THE TFC WHICH WAS AT AN UNCONFIRMED ALT. HE RELIED ON THIS TO ACHIEVE SEPARATION. NO VECTORS WERE GIVEN TO ASSURE HORIZ SEPARATION. I RELIED ON VISUALLY SIGHTING THE TFC THE WX WAS SO GOOD. AS A RESULT I DID NOT REQUEST A HDG TO ASSURE SEPARATION. I RELIED ON BDL TO PROVIDE HORIZ SEPARATION IN THE EVENT VISUAL SIGHTING WAS NOT ACHIEVED. MY NORMAL DSCNT PROFILE IS 240 KTS IAS/2200-2500 FPM. DURING DISCUSSION OF THE EVENT WITH BDL TRACON THE CTLR STATED OUR GND SPD WAS 270 KTS. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE ACFT WAS TRIMMED SLIGHTLY NOSE DOWN AND AS I BECAME INTENT ON THE TFC I ALLOWED THE SPD TO BUILD UP (ALTHOUGH I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE 270 KTS). I MAY HAVE PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE VISUAL SCAN AREA. THIS WOULD HAVE CREATED A RAPID DSCNT WHICH ELIMINATED THE REQUIRED VERT SEPARATION. CONCLUSION: IN THE FUTURE I WILL ALLOW OR ACCEPT ONLY HORIZ SEPARATION WITH VFR/IFR TFC AT UNCONFIRMED ALTS. IF NOT OFFERED; I WILL REQUEST THE SEPARATION.

WE HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT DURING THE ENTIRE EPISODE; BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE JUST WHERE HE WAS IN RELATION TO OUR POS. AFTER PASSING; WE QUESTIONED BOS AS TO HIS POS AND ALT. THE RESPONSE WAS DEFENSIVE AND THE CTLR STATED THAT HE TOLD US WE COULD LEVEL AT 15000 UNTIL TFC PASSED IF WE WISHED TO! NO ONE IN MY CREW HEARD THAT XMISSION. THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE VFR TFC SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FLY AGAINST GARDENER-2 ARR TFC AND CLBING THROUGH OUR DSCNT ALT.

OUR FO DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALL. I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC MIGHT BE GETTING CLOSE TO US SO I KEPT MY EYE ON HIM. AT APPROX 15000 FT OUR TCASII GAVE US A VERBAL RA OF 'REDUCE DSCNT; REDUCE DSCNT.' THIS CERTAINLY CAUGHT MY ATTN SO I GLANCED AT THE TCASII INST WHICH SHOWED A RED ARC ON THE LOWER HALF OF THE CASE.

OUR CAPT HAD NOT MADE ANY EVASIVE TURN; AND I NOTICED THAT OUR ALT BOTTOMED OUT AT 14300 FT AS WE PASSED OVER GARDNER VOR. THE CTLR NEVER ISSUED US ANY TURNS OR ALT CHANGES. THE VFR TFC DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CONFLICT. A FEW MI LATER; OUR FO TOLD THE CTR THAT WE HAD SEEN THE TFC PASS US AND ASKED WHAT ALT HE WAS AT. THE CTLR SAID HE WAS AT 14500 FT. AT THIS POINT; THE VFR TFC SAID HE THOUGH WE WERE TOLD THAT 'IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT WE MAINTAIN 15000 FT.' THE CTLR SAID NOTHING. MY AIRPLANE'S CREW MEMBERS NEVER HEARD THE 'SUGGESTION' AND CERTAINLY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY SUCH XMISSION AT THE TIME. IN MY MIND; THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION; I THOUGHT THAT THE VFR TFC WAS MAINTAINING 15000 FT AND THAT WE WOULD BE DSNDING WELL IN FRONT OF HIM. I FEEL THAT THE ATC CTLR'S LACK OF AGGRESSIVENESS; FAILURE TO CTL HIS AIRSPACE; AND OVERALL NONCHALANCE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TFC CONFLICT.

ATC RPTED HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO PROVIDE RADAR COVERAGE BUT ADVISED WE COULD SHOOT THE APCH ON OUR OWN USING THE CTAF. I RESPONDED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE USING THE CTAF BUT WOULD ALSO STICK WITH NEW YORK FOR ANY ADVISORIES HE COULD PROVIDE. THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE WHILE MY STUDENT AND I CRUISED AT 2500 FT DIRECT TO CLERA LOM FROM MERIDEN MARKHAM (MMK). I CALLED ON THE CTAF TO ADVISE LCL TFC OF OUR POS AND ALT AS WELL AS OUR INTENTION OF SHOOTING THE APCH. UPON REACHING THE LOM; MY STUDENT RAISED HIS L WING SO I COULD CLR THE AREA. SEEING NO TFC; I CLRED HIM TO TURN INTO THE HOLD ENTRY FOR COURSE REVERSAL. ONCE IN OUR STANDARD RATE TURN; I SAW A WHITE SMA WITH RED STRIPES ALMOST DIRECTLY BELOW US. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED AS THE TURN WAS TAKING US AWAY FROM THE LOWER TFC. IT APPEARED HE HAD BEEN COMING FROM OUR 7-8 O'CLOCK POS. THE OTHER SMA HELD HIS COURSE AND ALT AND CONTINUED ON TO THE W UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT. I CAN ONLY ASSUME HE NEVER SAW US AND WAS UNAWARE OF OUR CLOSE PROX. THE ONLY CAUSES I CAN IMAGINE IN THIS INSTANCE WERE A COMBINATION OF A POOR SCAN BY THE LOWER ACFT AS HE OVERTOOK MY OWN; AND HIS APPARENT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR POS DUE TO NOT MONITORING THE LCL RADIO FREQ. WHILE OXC IS AN UNCTLED ARPT; NOT REQUIRING RADIOS; I THINK A HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IF A PLT OPTS TO FLY THROUGH THE AREA SURROUNDING AN ARPT OF THIS SIZE AND WITH AS MUCH TFC AS IS IN THE AIR ON A REGULAR BASIS.

WE DEPARTED RWY 15; WE PENETRATED THE OVCST AT 500-600 FT; AND WERE PROMPTLY INSTRUCTED BY HYANNIS TWR TO CONTACT CAPE APCH. I CHANGED FREQS AND CONTACTED APCH CTL. I BRIEFLY TOOK MY EYES OFF OF THE INSTS; AS I FELT CONFIDENT IN MY STUDENT'S ABILITY TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE UNDER CTL BY REF TO INSTS. I RETURNED MY EYES BACK TO THE INST PANEL. I NOTICED THAT THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR WAS SHOWING THE ACFT TO BE IN A FAIRLY STEEP DSNDING BANK TO THE R. I BEGAN TO TELL MY STUDENT TO CORRECT FOR THIS. HE SAID 'SOMETHING'S WRONG.' AFTER XCHKING THE INSTS; I COULD SEE THAT IN FACT WE WERE IN A CLBING L BANK. I HESITATED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT; REFUSING TO BELIEVE MY INSTS; THEN IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED A VACUUM FAILURE. TAKING CTL OF THE AIRPLANE I BEGAN TO LEVEL THE WINGS; AND DECREASE OUR PITCH; AS I COULD SEE OUR AIRSPD DECREASING. I CONTACTED CAPE APCH AND ADVISED THEM OF OUR SIT; REQUESTING VECTORS FOR AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO HYANNIS. THEY RESPONDED AND ASKED IF I WISHED TO DECLARE AN EMER; TO WHICH I ANSWERED 'NEGATIVE;' FEARING THE POSSIBLE PAPERWORK AND QUESTIONS TO ANSWER IF I DID SO. I LEVELED OFF AT MY ASSIGNED ALT OF 1700 FT AND WAS SO FOCUSED ON TRYING TO CTL THE AIRPLANE WITH NO ATTITUDE INDICATOR; THAT I FAILED TO REALIZE THAT THE AIRPLANE HAD DEVIATED TO THE N; FROM OUR INITIALLY ASSIGNED HDG OF 150 DEGS. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; CAPE APCH INSTRUCTED ME TO MAKE A CLBING R TURN TO 3000 FT AND A HDG OF 200 DEGS. AS I BEGAN FIGURING OUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO TURN USING A TIMED TURN AT A STANDARD RATE; APCH CALLED BACK AGAIN WITH THE SAME INSTRUCTION; AND A SENSE OF URGENCY. I DID MY BEST TO COMPLETE AN ACCURATE TIMED TURN; WHILE CLBING; BUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY AT HAND FORCED ME TO COUNT TOO QUICKLY; RESULTING IN AN EARLY ROLLOUT AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE VECTOR IN A TIMELY MANNER. I LEVELED OUT AT 3000 FT AND NOTICED THAT THE HDG INDICATOR AND MAGNETIC COMPASS SHOWED THE SAME HDG; AND THE ATTITUDE INDICATOR SEEMED TO BE WORKING. HOWEVER; I DECIDED THAT I WOULD NOT TRUST THEM AND WOULD KEEP THEM OUT OF MY SCAN; USING ONLY MY REMAINING INSTS; AND USING TIMED TURNS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH VECTOR HDGS. CAPT APCH CALLED BACK; AND THE CTLR GAVE ME A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL WHEN I LANDED; AND INSTRUCTED ME TO ASK FOR THE SHIFT SUPVR. I BEGAN TO FEEL ADDED TENSION IN AN ALREADY TENSE SIT; AS I BELIEVED THAT THIS MEANT I WOULD BE IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE. I WAS THEN GIVEN SEVERAL VECTORS; WITH WHICH I TRIED MY BEST TO COMPLY USING TIMED TURNS; AND A MAGNETIC COMPASS; BUT HAD LIMITED SUCCESS; DEVIATING FROM MOST OF THEM DUE TO THE ADDED TENSION WHICH I FELT. I WAS THEN TOLD TO DSND TO 1700 FT AND EXPECT AN ILS APCH TO HYANNIS. FOCUSING MAINLY ON TRYING TO CTL THE AIRPLANE; AND MAINTAINING MY HDG USING ONLY A MAGNETIC COMPASS; I DSNDED TO APPROX 1200 FT BEFORE BEING TOLD BY THE CTLR THAT I WAS TOO LOW AND HAD TO CLB BACK UP TO 1700 FT. APCH CTL; SHORTLY THEREAFTER; CALLED BACK AND ASKED IF I WAS RECEIVING THE LOC. I LOOKED TO SEE IF I WAS; AND ALL I SAW IN BOTH WINDOWS WERE 'NAV' FLAGS. I RESPONDED THAT I WAS NOT RECEIVING THE LOC; AND AFTER SEVERAL EXCHANGES WITH ATC I REALIZED THAT THEY WERE GIVING ME THE ILS 24 APCH; AND I WAS EXPECTING THE ILS 25 APCH; FOR WHICH I WAS ALREADY SET UP. I QUICKLY LOOKED UP THE ILS 24 APCH PLATE; AND MANAGED TO GET THE CORRECT FREQS FOR THE APCH AND GET SET UP. I WAS VECTORED BACK TO THE 24 LOC; AND THE NEEDLE BEGAN TO COME IN SHORTLY THEREAFTER. CAPE APCH THEN CLRED ME FOR THE APCH; ADVISING ME THAT I WAS 2 MI FROM THE OM. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; THE CTLR CALLED ME BACK AND ADVISED ME TO CHK MY ALTIMETER SETTING; BECAUSE HE WAS GETTING A LOW ALT ALERT ON ME. I LOOKED AT MY ALTIMETER; AND SAW THAT I WAS AT 1000 FT AND LOOKING AT THE APCH PLATE; THE PROC MANDATES MAINTAINING 1700 FT UNTIL GS INTERCEPT. I BEGAN TO CLB BACK UP; AND RAPIDLY INTERCEPTED THE GS; AND BEGAN A DSCNT AGAIN. I THEN REALIZED THAT I HAD WANDERED OFF OF THE LOC AND REINTERCEPTED IT. AFTER A COUPLE OF DEVS FROM THE GS AND LOC; I BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AT APPROX 500 FT AND LANDED ON RWY 24 WITHOUT ANY FURTHER OCCURRENCES. UPON TAXIING IN AND SHUTTING THE AIRPLANE DOWN; I CALLED APCH CTL ON THE TELEPHONE; AS INSTRUCTED. THE CTLR THEN ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENED; AND AFTER MY BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS; ADVISED ME THAT I HAD COME WITHIN 400 FT OF ANOTHER ACFT. UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THE EVENTS AS THEY OCCURRED; I REALIZE THAT THE SIT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS SEVERE IF I HAD MAINTAINED A CONSTANT SCAN OF THE INST PANEL; AND TAKEN CTL OF THE ACFT FROM MY STUDENT SOONER. FURTHER DEVS FROM ATC INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF I MAINTAINED A BETTER SCAN; NOT FOCUSING SO MUCH ON THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A PROB WITH THE GYRO INSTS.

AS COULD BE EXPECTED THE VFR TFC WAS HVY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL HOLIDAY. COMBINE THIS WITH THE COMPLICATED AIRSPACE AROUND THE TCA AT RELIEVER ARPTS INCREASES THE CHANCE OF A CONFLICT MANY FOLD. OFF HAND; I CAN THINK OF 2 POTENTIAL DANGEROUS INCIDENTS INVOLVING MY ACFT ON THIS FLT. THEY ARE: A POSSIBLE NEAR MISS IN THE TFC PATTERN. ON DEP FROM RWY 27; I WAS CLRED FOR A R DEP TO CROSS MIDFIELD ABOVE 1600 FT MSL. AT THE TIME OF THIS CLRNC; I WAS LOOKING INTO THE SUN WHILE SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER ACFT THAT WAS LNDG RWY 9. SO; WHEN I GLANCED AT THE ALTIMETER; I MISTAKENLY READ 1600 FT INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL 600 FT. THUS; I CHKED OUT OF 1600 MSL AND STARTED THE TURN FOR THE R DOWNWIND DEP. I DIDN'T SEE THE ACFT THAT RPTED THE CONFLICT. INSTEAD; I HEARD THE RADIO XMISSION TO TWR AND REALIZED THE MISTAKE. MY ACFT CROSSED THE RWY 16 PATTERN RIGHT AT PATTERN ALT DURING THE CLB. NOT GOOD! GENERAL THOUGHTS: 1) FLYING A LIGHT SINGLE CAN BE AS DEMEANING AS A TURBOJET. SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN 'DOWNGRADING' TO A MORE BASIC ACFT; ESPECIALLY AFTER NOT FLYING ONE FOR A WHILE DUE TO BEING IN A LARGER ACFT. IT IS VERY EASY TO BECOME LOCKED INTO 'PROCS OF A 2-MAN CREW; OR WORSE YET; DEVELOP A 'COCKY' ATTITUDE FLYING THE TURBINE EQUIP. 2) AVOID EXPECTANCY! (I.E.; READING AN ALTIMETER WRONG). IT IS EASY IN A STRESSFUL SIT FOR THE MIND TO SEE WHAT IT IS EXPECTING TO SEE. THUS; WHEN A PERSON USUALLY FLIES ON ACFT CLBING AT 4000-7000 FPM; IT IS EASY TO THINK OF CLB IN TERMS OF FPM AS BEING A CONSTANT. THUS; 'I HAVE CLBED FOR 20 SECONDS; SO I SHOULD BE ABOVE THIS ALT' COMES TO MIND. 2 CONTRIBUTING SUB NOTES: A) DIFFERENCES IN ALTIMETERS. THE SMA HAS THE TYPICAL DARK TYPE OF ALTIMETER; WHERE MOST TURBOJET ACFT HAVE THE NUMERICAL READOUT FOR THOUSAND AND HUNDREDS OF FT. B) MY MIND HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED TO BE TURNING AT 1600 FT AS A RESULT OF FLYING THE TEB 2 DEP 4 NIGHTS A WK; WHICH CALLS FOR A TURN AT 1500 FT WHEN DEPARTING RWY 1. 3) CALM CAVU DAYS; ESPECIALLY HOLIDAYS BRING OUT ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS OF PLTS IN ABUNDANCE. THUS; CROSSED AIRSPACE BECOMES MORE CROWDED. READING CHARTS AND ANSWERING PAX QUESTIONS ARE DISTRS FROM LOOKING FOR OTHER ACFT AND FLYING THE ACFT. 4) WKEND VFR IN A LIGHT SINGLE IS HAZARDOUS.

WIND WAS FROM THE N AT ABOUT 15 ACCORDING TO PROVIDENCE ATIS. I HAD ENOUGH SIGHT OF THE RWY; THAT I ELECTED TO LAND 34 RATHER THAN TO RISK A HIGH XWIND ON 5-23. THE ACFT IS A TAILWHEEL ACFT AND CAN BE UNRULY AT NIGHT. I LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. UPON TAXIING OFF THE RWY; I ALMOST HIT A BARRICADE THAT WAS UNLIT. BRIDGEPORT FSS DID NOT ADVISE ME OF ANY CONSTRUCTION NOTAMS WHEN I WAS BRIEFED IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE FLT. AT THAT POINT; I HAD A VERY BAD ATTITUDE AND WAS RUDE TO BOTH PROVIDENCE APCH AND NEW BEDFORD TWR ON THE PHONE. I FELT THAT I WAS IN COMPLIANCE AND THAT THE TWIN PLT WAS BEING OBSTINATE; AND I WASN'T. UPON REACHING HOME; I CALLED THE FBO AND OBTAINED THE PLT'S NAME AND PHONE NUMBER. I APOLOGIZED AND WE DISCUSSED THE INCIDENT. UPON REVIEWING FAR 91.205 AND 91.209; IT HAD BECOME APPARENT I HAD MISREAD THE ROTATING BEACON RULES. I CALLED NEW BEDFORD TWR AND APOLOGIZED. SAT; I FLEW TO N CENTRAL STATE ARPT TO TALK TO AN ACCIDENT PREVENTION COUNSELOR. SUN; I DROVE TO PROVIDENCE APCH TO PICK UP A NASA FORM. FIRST OFF; I WAS WRONG IN MISREADING THE FARS ON NIGHT REQUIREMENTS. I WAS WRONG IN MAKING A FLT THAT WAS LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO NIGHT WITHOUT CHKING THE CHARGE ON THE BATTERY. I WAS WRONG IN ESTABLISHING A BAD ATTITUDE ABOUT THE INCIDENT. I WAS MOSTLY WRONG IN CONTINUING THE FLT BACK TO HOME BASE; AFTER DISCOVERING THAT THE POS LIGHTS WERE DIM; AND NOT PROPERLY DISCUSSING THE INCIDENT WITH ALL INVOLVED. ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING. I LIKE TO THINK I AM A CONSIDERATE PLT AND TRY TO BE SAFE. I REALIZE I NEED TO WORK HARD AT MY ATTITUDE IN SITS OF EXTREME STRESS.

THE CAPT LOOKED OUT HIS WINDOW; YELLED SOMETHING AND DOVE THE AIRPLANE. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME; I LOOKED TOWARDS HIS WINDOW AND SAW THE MIG FLY RIGHT ACROSS OUR NOSE. HE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO CLRLY SEE THE RED FLAG ON THE SIDE OF HIS FUSELAGE. JUST AFTER THE MIG PASSED; THE TWR CALLED HIM OUT AS TFC (TOO LITTLE; TOO LATE). I RESPONDED THAT WE HAD HIM IN SIGHT AND THE TWR MENTIONED HE WAS DOING 450 KTS. WE WERE THEN CLRED TO LAND BEHIND THE MIG (WHO AS IT TURNED OUT WAS DOING LOW APCHS). UPON ARR AT THE GATE I CALLED THE LCL CTLR ON THE PHONE TO DISCUSS THE SIT. HE TOLD ME WE HAD BEEN SPUN BECAUSE OF THE CESSNA; WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD; AND THAT HIS RADAR HAD FAILED AND THAT WAS WHY HE NEVER TOLD US ABOUT THE MIG UNTIL HE HAD PASSED US. HE SAID HE KNEW THE SPD OF THE MIG BECAUSE HIS RADAR SUDDENLY CAME BACK. WHEN I QUESTIONED HIM AS TO WHY THE MIG WAS GOING SO FAST IN THE FIRST PLACE; HE CORRECTLY EXPLAINED THAT THE MIG WAS EXEMPT FROM THE NORMAL 250 KT RESTR DUE TO ITS STALL CHARACTERISTICS. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE MIG EXCEEDING THE 250 KT RESTR BUT I DOUBT HE NEEDED TO BE DOING 450 KTS IN THE TFC PATTERN.

AFTER LATER TALKING WITH THE TWR PERSONNEL ON THE PHONE I FOUND OUT THAT VFR APCHS WERE BEING CONDUCTED TO RWY 16 WITH 3 LIGHT ACFT IN THE PATTERN. THIS TYPE OF TFC CONFIGN CAUSES AN OVERLAP IN TFC PATTERNS BTWN RWY 05 STRAIGHT IN APCHS AND R VFR PATTERNS TO RWY 16. I BELIEVE THE POOR VISIBILITY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT. ALSO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE LIGHT ACFT WAS FLYING A WIDE DOWNWIND OR THAT HE WAS NOT UNDER TWR CTL AND HAD STRAYED INTO THE ARPT TFC AREA. THE TWR PERSONNEL WERE NOT AWARE OF THE CONFLICT AND ASKED WHAT THE REASON FOR OUR MISSED APCH WAS. THE INTRUDING ACFT WAS A HIGH WING CESSNA TYPE ACFT. TO AVOID THIS TYPE CONFLICT IN THE FUTURE I THINK THAT XING TFC PATTERNS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED ESPECIALLY VISIBILITY LESS THAN 3-4 MI. IT IS TOO HARD TO SEE SMALL LIGHT ACFT WITH POOR VISIBILITY AT THE SPDS THAT ACR ACFT FLY.

THE FO WAS FLYING. AFTER RECEIVING THE ATIS INFO THE FO AND I DISCUSSED THE WX AND CONDITIONS AND DECIDED THAT I WOULD FLY THE APCH. I QUERIED APCH CTL AND WAS INFORMED THAT ACFT WERE LNDG AT PVD. I REQUESTED THAT; IN THE EVENT OF A MISSED APCH THAT WE BE CLRED STRAIGHT AHEAD TO 10000 FT MSL. WE WERE CLRED TO 6000 FT IN THE EVENT OF A MISSED APCH AND TOLD WE COULD EXPECT 10000 FT. OUR RADAR INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT WX ON OUR FLT PATH ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME BUILDUPS IN OUR VICINITY. AT 4000 FT MSL; THE WINDS ON THE FMS INDICATED 040 DEGS 101 KTS AND ALTHOUGH THE RIDE WAS A LITTLE BUMPY; IT WAS OK. AT APPROX 24 DME WE WERE CLRED TO 2000 FT TO INTERCEPT THE GS. I REQUESTED THAT WE STAY AT 4000 FT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER BUT WAS INSTRUCTED THAT I NEEDED TO DSND AT THAT TIME. THE ACFT WAS CONFIGURED WITH SLATS AND WE WERE INDICATING 220 KIAS. I STARTED THE ACFT DOWN USING THE AUTOPLT WITH A 1000 FPM RATE OF DSCNT. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WE ENCOUNTERED 'MODERATE' TURB. PASSING THROUGH ABOUT 2500 FT MSL; I NOTICED THAT THE ACFT WAS DSNDING IN EXCESS OF 2000 FPM AND WOULD NOT CATCH THE 2000 FT MSL ALT. ABOUT THAT TIME THE 'WIND SHEAR' WARNING ACTUATED AND THE ACFT DSNDED TO APPROX 1600 FT MSL. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND APPLIED PWR -- WE BEGAN TO CLB RAPIDLY. I ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING MISSED APCH AND ASKED THAT THE FO RELAY THAT TO DEP CTL. PASSING THROUGH ABOUT 3000 FT MSL; THE TCASII ANNOUNCED TFC AT ABOUT OUR 11:30 POS HIGH AND COMMANDED A DSCNT. I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED UP AND SAW 2 LIGHTS SLIGHTLY L OF OUR 12 O'CLOCK POS. I WENT INTO AN IMMEDIATE HARD R TURN AND PUSHED THE NOSE OF THE ACFT OVER. SOMEWHERE DURING THIS MANEUVER THE 'WINDSHEAR' WARNING SOUNDED AGAIN AS DID THE 'SLATS OVERSPD' WARNING. OUR JUMPSEAT RIDER TOLD ME TO WATCH MY ATTITUDE. WE WERE IN A 70 DEG R BANK TURN WITH A 5 DEGS NOSE LOW ATTITUDE PASSING A LITTLE BELOW 3000 FT MSL AT APPROX 300 KIAS. SOMETIME DURING ALL OF THIS THE CTLR WAS ASKING WHERE WE WERE GOING; ANNOUNCING THE TFC; AND TELLING US TO LEVEL OFF AT 3000 FT MSL. AFTER THE SIT WAS UNDER CTL WE WERE ASKED OUR INTENTIONS. WE STATED THAT WE WISHED TO PROCEED TO OUR ALTERNATE BANGOR; ME. AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH FLT CTL; WE PROCEEDED TO BDL. I TALKED WITH APCH CTL AFTER THIS EVENT AND ASKED WHY THERE WAS AN AIRPLANE 2000 FT ABOVE ME ON THE SAME APCH COURSE. I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AT A HIGHER SPD THAT I SHOULD HAVE PASSED AHEAD OF HIM BEFORE HE BEGAN HIS DSCNT AND THAT THE CTLR DID NOT EXPECT ME TO GAR AT 18 MI FROM THE FIELD. I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER WIND SHEAR WHICH COMMANDED A CLB EITHER. I THINK WE BOTH LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THIS.

AFTER INITIATING THE CLB; THE TCASII ISSUED A TA; WHEREUPON THE FO; FLYING THE PLANE; INCREASED THE CLB RATE. THE TA WAS FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY AN INSISTENT RA ('DSND! DSND NOW!). SINCE WE WERE ALREADY COMMITTED TO A HIGH RATE OF CLB AT APPROX 20 DEG DECK ANGLE AND 5000 FPM RATE OF CLB AND TRADING AIRSPD FOR ALT FROM THE INITIAL 310 KTS; WE CONTINUED THE CLB AND MADE A CLRING TURN OF ABOUT 30 DEGS TO THE L OF OUR RTE CLRNC.

THE OTHER TFC MADE NO APPARENT CHANGE IN FLT PATH OR ALT. THE TFC PASSED ALMOST DIRECTLY BELOW US. 1) ZBW WAS REMISS IN ISSUING THESE CLB INSTRUCTIONS -- THIS IS A TECHNIQUE ALLOWED FOR APCH/DEP CTL BUT NOT FOR ARTCC. 2) WE WERE MISTAKEN IN ACCEPTING THIS CLRNC; AND THEN IN INITIATING THE CLB WHICH RESULTED IN REDUCED SEPARATION. 3) IT IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS TO DISREGARD A TCASII RA; BUT UNDER VISUAL CONDITIONS WE WERE MORE COMFORTABLE DOING THIS THAN ATTEMPTING TO TRANSITION FROM A 5000 FPM CLB TO A 3000 FPM DSCNT. THE BIG PROB POTENTIAL IS THAT THE OTHER TFC WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED A 'CLB' RA WHICH WOULD HAVE FURTHER REDUCED SEPARATION.

I IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED CWS ON THE AUTOPLT AND STARTED A 5000-6000 FPM CLB. IMMEDIATELY AFTER I INITIATED THE CLB; TCASII DISPLAYED A TA ALERT. SOON AFTER; TCASII DISPLAYED AN RA; COMMANDING A DSCNT.

AT APPROX XX30Z I WAS WORKING AN HVT FLT EBOUND FROM JFK; THE FLT WAS CLBING TO FL550 B600. I WAS ALSO WORKING A GULSTREAM; G4; FLYING FROM ACK LACKS FLANN A523 TO DEST. WHEN THE ACFT WERE APPROX 100 MI APART I OBSERVED THAT BOTH ACFT WERE AT FL430. I BELIEVED THAT THE ACFT WOULD CROSS IN THE VICINITY OF LACKS INTXN AND THAT I WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ALT SEPARATION. I WAS INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL COMPLEX SITS WITH OTHER ACFT. WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THIS SIT I HAD APPROX 60 MI BTWN THE ACFT WITH THE HVT CLBING OUT OF FL440. I ASKED IF THE HVT WOULD BE OUT OF FL450 WITHIN THE NEXT 40 MI. HE SAID 'YES.' AGAIN; I WAS DISTRACTED WITH ANOTHER SIT WHEN I AGAIN LOOKED AT THE CONCORD THE FLT WAS AT FL443 AND APPROX 25 MI FROM THE G4. I AGAIN ASKED THE FLT IF HE WOULD BE OUT OF FL450. AT THIS TIME HE STATED THAT HE HAD ENCOUNTERED A TEMP INVERSION AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CLB. THE HVT PLT WENT INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE TEMP INVERSION AND I WAS UNABLE TO BROADCAST ON THE FREQ TO DSND THE G4. I HAD A HALO ON THE G4 AND IT WAS OBVIOUS NOW THAT THE TARGETS WERE GOING TO MERGE. WHEN THE HVT FINISHED I IMMEDIATELY DSNDED THE G4 AND CALLED TFC TO THE FLT. AS THE HVT ENTERED THE HALO HE WAS SHOWING FL443 I ASKED THE G4 TO CONFIRM OUT OF FL420 AND HE CONCURRED. THE PLT OF THE G4 THEN STATED THAT HE HAD JUST FLOWN THROUGH THE SONIC BOOM OF THE HVT AND THAT IT HAD BEEN A VERY UNPLEASANT SIT TO BE IN. WITH THE SPDS INVOLVED AND THE RATES OF CLB THE RADAR SNITCH DID NOT ACTIVATE. HOWEVER; I BELIEVE THAT THE ACFT PASSED WITHIN 1400 FT OF EACH OTHER. THE HVT WAS ACCELERATING TO MACH 2 AT THE TIME. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER ENCOUNTERED A SIT WHERE THE HVT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE HIS CLB. NORMALLY THE HVT IS OUT OF FL470 AT THE POINT WHERE THESE ACFT PASSED. ALTHOUGH I IDENTED THE SIT EARLY I DID NOT TAKE POSITIVE CTL OF THE SIT TO ENSURE SEPARATION OF THE ACFT. I HAD SEVERAL OPTIONS AVAILABLE FROM STOPPING THE G4 AT A LOWER ALT INITIALLY OR VECTORING THE ACFT TO PLACE THE HVT BEHIND THE G4.

I TELL ATC 'XXX CLBING FOR TCASII TFC.' THIS ALL HAPPENED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY. ATC SAYS 'I DON'T SEE ANY TFC OUT THERE' AND 'YOU HAVE SAAB TFC ABOVE YOU AT 4000 FT.' WE KNEW; AND HAD SEEN; THE SAAB. HE WAS AT 4000 FT; BUT ALSO WAS BEHIND US. ATC THEN ASKED SAAB; 'DO YOU SHOW TCASII TFC AT 3000 FT?' SAAB SAID NO. BY NOW WE HAVE PASSED OVER TFC AND STARTED TO DSND. THE HIGHEST WE GOT WAS 3600 FT MSL BRIEFLY. AS WE DSND THROUGH 3400 FT; ATC SAYS HE SAW NO TFC; THAT WE HAD IFR TFC (THE SAAB) AT 4000 FT. THAT HE WOULD WRITE UP OUR ALTDEV; THEN SAYS CLB TO 9000 FT. WE PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY. NOW THAT THINGS HAD CALMED DOWN; WE REALIZED WE DID NOT GET A TCASII COMMAND! ATC AND THE SAAB DID NOT 'SEE' HIM BECAUSE HE DID NOT USE A XPONDER! WE HAVE HAD TCASII ABOUT 2 YRS. IT IS A GREAT TOOL. OPERATING IN THE NE; WE GET OCCASIONAL RA'S. WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO TCASII CALLOUTS. THAT IS WHY I INCORRECTLY USED 'CLBING FOR TCASII COMMAND.' THE TFC WAS THERE; AND I BELIEVE A MIDAIR COLLISION MAY HAVE OCCURRED HAD WE NOT TAKEN EVASIVE ACTION. WE DID THE RIGHT THING. WE ARE ALIVE. OUR ERROR; IN THE INTENSITY OF THE EVENT; WAS INCORRECT TERMINOLOGY OF OUR ACTIONS; AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT TCASII WAS 'CALLING.' TCASII IS A GREAT TOOL; BUT SCANNING WILL STILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THIS FLC WAS FLYING A CORPORATE CITATION III AND THEIR PRIMARY PROB IN THIS EVENT IS THAT THEY IMPROPERLY USED THE TERMINOLOGY TCASII INSTEAD OF AVOIDING TFC IN SIGHT. SINCE THE CTLR DID NOT SEE THE INTRUDER ON HIS SCOPE; HE ASSUMED THAT IT WAS NOT THERE WHEN THE FLC USED THE IMPROPER TERMINOLOGY. THE FLC RECOGNIZES THEIR ERROR; BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY THINK THAT THE CTLR WAS A BIT TOO AGGRESSIVE TOWARD THEM. THEY HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE FAA. THE ORIGINAL ACFT THAT THE FLC SAW WAS A CESSNA 172 (A VERY OLD MODEL) WITH A SINGLE PERSON ON BOARD. THIS ACFT NEVER CHANGED COURSE OR ALT AND THE RPTRS DO NOT THINK HE SAW ANY OF THE OTHER TFC.",,,,"SEE AND AVOID CONCEPT.

DURING DSCNT I WAS PNF AND HAD ACQUIRED ATIS FOR MHT. AS PER THE CHKLIST ALL THE ATIS ITEMS WERE BRIEFED; AND AS I READ OFF THE ALTIMETER TO THE FO (PF) I HELD UP AND POINTED TO THE ATIS NUMBER AND ALTIMETER READING '29.64.' HE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER; REPEATED IT AND I WATCHED HIM DIAL IT IN; AS I DIALED IT INTO MY 2 ALTIMETERS (NORMAL AND STANDBY). THE CTLR WANTED A RAPID RATE OF DSCNT. WE OBLIGED WITH 3000 FPM. I CAUTIONED THE FO THAT THE AUTOPLT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DISREGARD THE ALT PRESELECTED AND PENETRATE SET ALTS. NOT JUST THIS ACFT; PROB IS FLEETWIDE. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AND WAS READY FOR IT. THE ASSIGNED ALT WAS TO BE 11000 FT. AT 13000 FT I CAUTIONED THE FO TO EXPECT CAPTURE SOON AND FAILING THAT TO DISENGAGE THE AUTOPLT AND EFFECT THE LEVEL OFF. HE SAID HE WOULD. WITH 3000 FPM DSCNT; I AGAIN STATED THIS AT 12000 FT. AND AT 11500 FT SAID; 'LEVEL OFF IT'S GOING TO GO THROUGH IT!' ATC WANTS TO KNOW OUR ALT AS WE PASS THROUGH 11000 FT; AND AS I CHK HIS ALTIMETER IT READS LEVEL AT 11000 FT WHILE MINE READS 10000 FT.

I FOUND THE TFC AT 7-6 MI; 1-2 MI HIGHER; AND LATER CLOSEST PASS WAS 2 - 2 1/2 AND SEVERAL HUNDRED VERT. I CHKED ALL 3 ALTIMETERS. MY 2 WERE CORRECTLY SET. HIS WAS INCORRECTLY SET TO 30.46. I CHKED THE ATIS CARD; HOWEVER THE WRITING WAS CLR AND LARGE ENOUGH NOT TO CONFUSE -- NOR COULD HE EXPLAIN IT. HE WAS VERY APOLOGETIC AND IS OTHERWISE A VERY DEPENDABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY CREW MEMBER. I CAN ONLY THINK HE MIGHT HAVE DIALED IN PART OF A FREQ HE HEARD DURING THE DSCNT. I WILL CHK THIS THROUGH ON FUTURE FLTS TO MHT. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: THIS AIRPLANE IS DARK. DAMNED DARK! ALL OF THEM ARE! I'M CERTAIN THAT IF MORE INST/COCKPIT ILLUMINATION EXISTED THIS WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED; AND ON THE RAMP WITHOUT AN ENG RUNNING IT'S MUCH WORSE. I WOULD ALSO VOTE IN FAVOR OF AN ALTIMETER COMPARATOR WARNING SYS. IF INSTALLED IT WOULD ALERT PLTS TO THE POTENTIAL MIS- SETTING OF THEIR ALTIMETERS. WE HAVE A HDG COMPARATOR WARNING ANNUNCIATOR AND THEY DO A FINE JOB. THE HDG COMPARATOR SHOWS A 'C' IN ORANGE ON THE EAS IF HDGS DIFFER BY MORE THAN 6 DEGS TOTAL. IN THE FUTURE I'LL HAVE THE FO CALL OUT THE ATIS NUMBER FOR THE ALTIMETER INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING AN 'OK' AS CONFIRMATION THAT HE HAS CORRECTLY SET THE ALTIMETER.

AT THIS TIME I EXECUTED A 180 DEG TURN TOWARDS THE S AND WAS ADVISED BY HVN TWR; 'APCH HAS ADVISED OF A CONFLICT WITH AN ACFT ON RWY 2 APCH COURSE.' I ELECTED TO TURN L APPROX 260 DEGS FROM A HDG OF 170 DEGS BACK THROUGH N TO 270 DEGS. THIS PROLONGED MY TIME IN IMC; BUT TURNED ME AWAY FROM THE RWY 02 APCH COURSE. AS SOON AS I ESTABLISHED THE 270 DEG HDG VMC CONDITIONS RESUMED. THE PROB AROSE BECAUSE I HAD GOOD VISIBILITY INITIALLY IN THE SNOWSHOWERS AND ASSUMED THEY WERE A LCL PHENOMENA. THE GENERAL POOR VISIBILITY OVER LONG ISLAND SOUND AT NIGHT MASKED THE TRUE SIZE OF THE SNOWSHOWER ACTIVITY. I FEEL MY CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS SWIFT; ALTHOUGH I DID NOT IDENT THE IMC CONDITION IN A TIMELY ENOUGH MANNER. THE GOOD WX AT BDR LED ME TO CONCLUDE THAT HVN WAS OKAY; VMC. THIS WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY THE EARLIER WX BRIEFING. I AM REALLY ANGRY WITH MYSELF FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE HVN ATIS PRIOR TO CONTACTING THE TWR. THIS WAS AN INEXCUSABLE; LAZY; AND UNNECESSARY OVERSIGHT. NEVER AGAIN. ALTHOUGH THIS EVENT IS A VMC INTO IMC INCIDENT; IT HAS MADE ME RE-EVALUATE MY GENERAL OPERATING GUIDELINES FOR VFR VERSUS IFR. I CONTINUED THE FLT SUCCESSFULLY IN GOOD VFR AT 9500 FT. AS A SINGLE ENG; NO ICE AIRPLANE DRIVER; I HAVE OFTEN OPTED FOR THE 'SCUDDY' FLT OVER FILING IFR. IN THIS CASE; THIS WAS A TRULY POOR CHOICE.

BUT AS SOON AS THE WX BRIEFING RPTED 'ICE' I DISCOUNTED IFR AS A POSSIBLE CHOICE. FURTHERMORE; I REMEMBER THINKING OVER BDR THAT I COULD SEE THE 'STARS ABOVE' IN MOST DIRECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW WHY I CONTINUED INTO THE SNOWSHOWER ACTIVITY WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY TO CLB VFR TO SEE HOW HIGH THE SNOW PRODUCING CLOUDS WERE. AT THAT POINT; A GO-NO-GO DECISION COULD HAVE BEEN MADE WITHOUT PRESSURE. THE CLASSIC HUMAN FACTORS WERE AT WORK HERE. I WAS LATE FOR A PLANNED DINNER AND MY 'GET-THERE-ITIS' MADE IT TOO EASY TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT I COULD SEE THE EDGE OF THE SNOWSHOWERS.

DURING THE TRAINING FLT; COM #1 HAD SOME AUDIO DISTORTION; AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MARGINAL SQUELCH SETTING. I USED COM #2 AS MY PRIMARY RADIO FOR THE FLT. WE WERE USING A BATTERY-PWRED INTERCOM FOR THE PLT AND BOTH PAX. I WAS USING A YOKE-MOUNTED VFR GPS (GARMIN 195). THE GPS WAS RUNNING ON A CIGARETTE-LIGHTER PLUG INTERFACE TO THE ACFT ELECTRICAL SYS; WITH ITS INTERNAL RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AS BACKUP. THE BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED AT THE START OF THE DAY; IT HAS A 7 HR LIFE-SPAN WITH NO BACK-LIGHT. I HAD A HAND-HELD RADIO (ICOM ICA-21) IN MY FLT BAG. IT STARTED THE DAY WITH A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY AS WELL. THE FLT NORTHWARD COMMENCED AT XY30 LCL; AND WAS UNEVENTFUL EXCEPT FOR THE #1 COM RADIO ACTING UP. WE LANDED. ON THE SBOUND FLT AT 4500 FT MSL; NAV WAS VISUAL; VOR AND GPS. WE WERE RECEIVING ADVISORIES FROM ATC; WERE SQUAWKING A CODE AND WERE IN CONTACT WITH BRUNSWICK; PORTLAND; AND MANCHESTER APCH CTLRS. OUR ELECTRICAL FAILURE OCCURRED WHILE WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH MANCHESTER APCH 125.05. WE WERE FLYING INTO A SUNSET; AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE LNDG WAS GOING TO EFFECTIVELY BE A NIGHT LNDG. THE SBOUND FLT PROCEEDED NORMALLY UNTIL FAILURE OF RADIO #1 LESS THAN 20 MI N OF PSM. THE DISPLAY BEGAN FLASHING ERRATICALLY; I CONCLUDED THAT #1 RADIO FAILED. I SHUT OFF RADIO #1. MANCHESTER APCH RPTED LOSS OF MY SQUAWK; AND REQUESTED THAT I RECYCLE MY XPONDER. I NOTICED THAT THE LIGHT ON THE XPONDER HAD BEEN REMAINING ON SOLIDLY; AND IT WAS DIM. UPON RECYCLING THE XPONDER; MANCHESTER APCH STILL DID NOT RECEIVE MY SQUAWK. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT RADIO #2 FAILED IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS #1. I TURNED OFF RADIO #2. I TURNED TOWARD PSM WHICH WAS IN SIGHT AND AT ABOUT 4 MI. I SET MY XPONDER FOR 7600 AND PRESSED IDENT. NO LIGHT CAME ON AND I REALIZED THAT THE XPONDER WAS OUT. IT WAS THEN THAT I CHKED THE ALTERNATOR (GENERATOR?) METER FOR CHARGING CURRENT AND IT READ ZERO. I INTERPRETED THIS AS AN ALTERNATOR FAILURE; AND REALIZED THAT WE HAD ONLY BATTERY PWR LEFT. I TURNED OFF ALL ELECTRICALS EXCEPT THE TAIL STROBE. I ASKED MY WIFE; WHO WAS IN THE BACK SEAT TO GIVE ME THE HAND-HELD RADIO. I TRIED CALLING MANCHESTER APCH ON 125.05; BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. I WAS ALMOST ON TOP OF PSM AT 4500 FT MSL AT THIS POINT; SO I CALLED PSM TWR; AND ASKED THEM TO RELAY MY SIT TO APCH. I CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS EFFECTIVELY NO DIFFERENCE IN SAFETY LNDG AT PSM OR LNDG AT LWM ABOUT 12 MINS AWAY. I INFORMED MANCHESTER APCH OF MY INTENTIONS; AND THEY ASKED TO BE INFORMED WHEN I SWITCHED TO LWM TWR FREQ. AT THIS TIME; I LOOKED DOWN AT MY GPS WHICH WAS ON THE HSI DISPLAY PAGE. THE WAYPOINT IT WAS NAVING TO WAS LWM; WHICH IS CORRECT FOR LAWRENCE ARPT. IT INDICATED A GND TRACK REQUIRED OF ABOUT 240 DEGS. I TURNED DIRECTLY TOWARD THE WAYPOINT AND PRESSED 'GOTO' AND 'ENTER' TO CREATE A NEW RADIAL TO THE WAYPOINT. THE DEFAULT WAYPOINT IN THE GOTO SCREEN IS THE CURRENT GOTO WAYPOINT; THIS IS A QUICK WAY TO RESET THE COURSE LINE. CREATING THE NEW RADIAL RE- CTRED THE NEEDLE; AND I BEGAN CAREFULLY NAVING DIRECTLY TO LWM. I USED A FEATURE OF THE GARMIN 195 WHICH GIVES VERT NAV INFO; AND BEGAN A DSCNT OF 500 FPM BASED UPON GPS INFO. I THOUGHT I HAD IDENTED THE ARPT VICINITY AT 12 O'CLOCK; BUT THIS LATER TURNED OUT TO BE ROCKINGHAM PARK; A RACETRACK. I LATER REALIZED THAT THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS ALONG WITH THE NAVIGATIONAL ISSUES CAUSED ME TO NOT COMPLETE MY FULL LNDG CHKLIST. I LANDED WITHOUT THE MIXTURE IN THE FULL RICH POS. THIS WAS A PROCEDURAL ERROR ON MY PART. THE HSI SCREEN OF THE GPS WAS GIVING ME ERRONEOUS INFO; BUT THE MAP SCREEN WAS CORRECT. I REALIZED THAT THE HSI DISPLAY WAS STEERING ME ON A PARALLEL TRACK; BUT 5.6 MI TO THE R (NW) OF THE CORRECT COURSE. I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I SWITCHED TO THE MAP DISPLAY; I LOOKED FOR THE LUBBER LINE ON THE STRIP COMPASS. ON THE GARMIN 195; THE LUBBER LINE ALWAYS INDICATES THE GND TRACK TO THE CURRENT WAYPOINT. THE LUBBER LINE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN; EVEN THOUGH THE HSI DISPLAY INDICATED MY WAYPOINT WAS DEAD AHEAD. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SOFTWARE BUG IN THE GARMIN 195 (SOFTWARE VERSION 2.01) SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE HSI DISPLAY. I VISUALLY PICKED UP THE ARPT OFF THE L WING AND TURNED TO ENTER A WIDE DOWNWIND FOR RWY 32 AT LWM. I ANNOUNCED MY TURN TO FINAL ON THE HAND-HELD. THE LWM TWR CTLR (CTLR #1) CLRED THE OTHER ACFT FOR DEP. THIS WAS A NIGHT LNDG AND ONE WITH A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL FAILURE. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRUDENT TO HOLD UP THE ACFT ON THE GND UNTIL I WAS DOWN AND OUT OF THE PATTERN. I HAD NOT DECLARED AN EMER. I STARTED THE FLT WITH 3 LEVELS OF NAV: VISUAL; GPS; VOR. AFTER THE ELECTRICAL SYS FAILURE; I SEEMED TO GET 'TUNNEL VISION' ON THE GPS; EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATING ANY XCHK WITH MY VISUAL NAV. I THINK CTLR #2 HAD A HARD TIME JUDGING MY DISTANCE WHEN I WAS ON FINAL APCH. I HAD ONLY A TAIL STROBE VISIBLE. THE A&P MECH VERIFIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED A VOLTAGE REGULATOR FAILURE. THE ALTERNATOR ITSELF WAS REBUILT WITHIN THE LAST YR. GARMIN VERIFIED THAT THEIR SOFTWARE UPDATES (THEY ARE UP TO 2.04; MY UNIT WAS 2.01) HAD CORRECTED BUGS IN THE HSI DISPLAY.

AFTER BEING ON THE BOS APCH FREQ FOR A SHORT TIME; PERHAPS 2 MINS; A PIPER CHEROKEE TYPE ACFT FLEW DIRECTLY OVER US EXACTLY ON OUR HDG. I RPTED THIS TO APCH; AND TOLD THEM THAT THE OTHER ACFT HAD COME WITHIN 50 FT OF US. IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SEPARATION VERTLY WAS CLOSER TO 25 FT. LATERAL SEPARATION WAS NEARLY ZERO. I LEVELED AND BEGAN A SLIGHT R TURN. THE CHEROKEE BEGAN SLOWLY TURNING TO MY L AND APPARENTLY ON COURSE. THE TIME WAS APPROX XA10Z. FROM THE ACFT ACTIONS; I ASSUMED HE HAD NEVER SEEN ME. I FURTHER ASSUME THAT HE WAS STILL ON THE TWR FREQ AT THE TIME. I TOLD APCH THAT I WANTED TO FILE A NEAR MISS RPT. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO DO THAT WITH THE FSDO. I SAID THAT I JUST WANTED THAT REQUEST ON THE TAPE. I ASKED APCH IF THEY SHOWED THE OTHER TARGET ON THEIR SCREEN. INITIALLY HE DID NOT RPT THE OTHER TARGET. PERHAPS 30 SECONDS LATER HE RPTED A TARGET AT 1900 FT AT MY 11 O'CLOCK POS. I TOLD APCH THAT THAT WAS THE OTHER ACFT. I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE OTHER ACFT AND I HAD ALREADY CLBED ABOVE IT. THE RANGE WAS PERHAPS 1 MI. THIS INDICATES THAT BOTH ACFT WERE SQUAWKING MODE C AND THE RADAR TAPES SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE STORY.

I REMAINED AT ABOUT 2200 FT FOR SEVERAL MI; UNTIL THE CTLR CLRED US INTO BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE AT 4500 FT DIRECT PUT.

THIS DIVERTED MY ATTN FROM THE RWY 6 OP. THEN ACFT ZZ ON FINAL TO RWY 33 CALLED. THE UNFAMILIAR TYPE OF THIS ACFT CAUSED CONCERN.

WITH SOME URGENCY IN HIS VOICE HE TOLD US TO RETURN TO 9000 FT; PROBABLY DUE TO THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC WHICH BY THIS TIME WAS NOT A FACTOR. HE THEN ASKED WHO GAVE US 10000 FT AND THE FREQ CHANGE. I SAID THE PREVIOUS CTLR. BY THIS POINT; SO MUCH CONFUSION EXISTED THAT THE CAPT AND I COULD NOT BE SURE WHICH FREQ WE WERE ACTUALLY ON WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO MAINTAIN 10000 FT. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT REALIZE IT AT THE TIME; THERE WERE SOME ITEMS THAT DID NOT SEEM RIGHT. FIRST; THE FLT PLANNED RTE WAS FOR 9000 FT MSL AND WE WERE NOW AT 10000 FT MSL. SECOND; WE HAD JUST COME FROM 118.00 TO 132.25 SO WHY WOULD WE BE HANDED BACK TO 118.00. IN THAT MOMENT; WE WERE SIMPLY COMPLYING WITH ATC'S INSTRUCTIONS. MY CAPT AND I DISCUSSED THE EVENTS THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED AND WONDERED HOW WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN TO 10000 FT IF ATC ACTUALLY WANTED US AT 9000 FT. I HAD READ BACK THE ALT ASSIGNMENT (ALONG WITH THE FREQ CHANGE) AND SELECTED IT IN THE ALT SELECTOR. AFTER REVIEWING THE SIT; MY ONLY GUESS IS THAT MAYBE I ACKNOWLEDGED AN ALT AND FREQ CHANGE THAT WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN TO ANOTHER ACFT GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY WE WERE GETTING HANDED BACK TO 118.00 AND GIVEN 10000 FT; ALL POSSIBLE INSTRUCTION FOR A WBOUND ACFT. NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ATC THAT MY READBACK WAS INCORRECT OR THAT THE COMMAND WAS ACTUALLY FOR ANOTHER ACFT WAS RECEIVED; AS FAR AS I KNOW. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE CTLR WAS NOT VIGILANT IN LISTENING TO MY READBACK OR THAT I SWITCHED FREQS BEFORE THE CTLR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ME. AS FOR THE REASON THAT ATC DID NOT POINT OUT TFC TO US MAY HAVE BEEN THAT WE WERE 'BTWN' FREQS AS A RESULT OF THE HDOF CONFUSION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE.

I HAD NOT FILED A FLT PLAN AND WAS FLYING PURELY VFR WITHOUT FLT FOLLOWING. UPON CLRING THE ORH AIRSPACE; MY FIRST CONCERN WAS TO BE SURE TO AVOID RESTR AREA R4102. DURING MY EARLIER FLT DOWN TO ORH FROM MHT; DURING WHICH I DID USE FLT FOLLOWING; BOSTON APCH HAD WARNED ME THAT R4102 WAS ACTIVE. UPON SAFELY PASSING R4102 I WAS ABOUT 4 MINS FLYING TIME FROM THE ASH AIRSPACE. I PICKED UP THE ASH ATIS AND WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE WIND. WIND AT ORH HAD BEEN GUSTING TO 22 KTS AND IF IT WERE THAT STRONG AT ASH AND FROM THE SAME DIRECTION IT WOULD EXCEED MY PERSONAL XWIND COMFORT LEVEL. THE ASH ATIS; AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT; GARBLED THE WIND VELOCITY FIGURE; SOUNDING LIKE EITHER '8' OR '18' KTS. LISTENED TO 4 REPETITIONS OF THE ATIS STILL WITHOUT BEING SURE OF THE WIND VELOCITY. BY THAT TIME; I WAS ALMOST UPON THE ASH AIRSPACE. BECAUSE ASH IS VERY BUSY WITH TRAINING FLTS; IT CAN SOMETIMES TAKE A MIN OR 2 TO ESTABLISH COM WITH THEM. WHEN I DID; THEY TOLD ME TO ENTER A L BASE FOR THEIR RWY 14. BY THAT TIME; I KNEW I WAS MORE OR LESS OVER PEPPERELL SPORTS CENTER/ARPT (5M6) BUT IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE ITS SHORT; NARROW RWY. TO MY HORROR; I SAW 1 PARACHUTE JUMPER DSNDING THROUGH MY ALT (ABOUT 1500 FT) TO MY R; AND ANOTHER GROUP OF THEM TO MY L. I WOULD ESTIMATE LATERAL SEPARATION OF ABOUT 1000 FT. I CONTINUED AND LANDED AT ASH. I THINK THE PRESENT LACK OF BROAD DISSEMINATION OF JUMPING INFO AT PEPPERELL IS DANGEROUS AND IS THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR MY FILING THIS FORM. THE ASH ATIS HAS A STANDARD WARNING PHRASE ABOUT JUMPING ACTIVITY AT PEPPERELL; BUT IT IS BROADCAST ALL THE TIME; WHETHER THERE IS JUMPING ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE OR NOT AT A GIVEN TIME; SO IS NOT VERY HELPFUL. BY THE TIME SOMEONE GETS TO THAT AREA COMING FROM THE S; HE/SHE IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE TALKING TO EITHER ASH TWR OR MHT APCH CTL; AND THUS UNABLE TO MONITOR THE PEPPERELL UNICOM. I ASSUME (ALTHOUGH I HAVE TRUTHFULLY NEVER HEARD ONE) THAT THE PEPPERELL JUMP PLANES BROADCAST ONE OR MORE WARNINGS AND A 'JUMPERS AWAY' STATEMENT. THE TROUBLE IS; IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED TO HEAR THEM WILL BE ABLE TO. I SUGGEST THAT JUMP INFO BE RELAYED IN REAL TIME TO AT LEAST THE ASH TWR AND PERHAPS ALSO MHT APCH CTL; WHO COULD THEN REBROADCAST THE INFO ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FREQS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ALL PLANES IN THE AREA WOULD GET THE INFO; IN THAT VIRTUALLY OF ALL THEM ARE OBLIGATED TO BE IN COM WITH EITHER MHT APCH OR ASH TWR. I KNOW THAT PEPPERELL IS NOT FORMALLY INSIDE EITHER MHT OR ASH AIRSPACE; BUT CAN'T SOMETHING LIKE THE ABOVE BE DONE BASED ON COMMON SENSE AND SAFETY EFFECTIVENESS? A VARIATION ON THE ABOVE SUGGESTION WOULD BE FOR THE JUMP PLANE TO BE GIVEN PERMISSION TO BROADCAST THE JUMP STATUS ON THE ASH TWR AND MHT APCH FREQS. I BELIEVE THIS IS DONE OVER NEAR ALBANY; NY; AND EVERYONE THEREFORE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON. ANOTHER IDEA WOULD BE TO REVISE THE ASH ATIS TO STATE SOMETHING LIKE (WHEN IT IS ACTUALLY TRUE) 'JUMPING ACTIVITY WILL TAKE PLACE AT PEPPERELL SPORTS CENTER DURING THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD OF THIS ATIS BROADCAST; MONITOR PEPPERELL UNICOM WHEN IN AREA.' I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IN THE FUTURE; I WILL RELIGIOUSLY INQUIRE ON PEPPERELL UNICOM WHEN I AM ANYWHERE NEAR THEM; BUT IF SOMETHING IS NOT CHANGED; SOMEONE ELSE MAY HAVE A LAPSE LIKE MINE; AND SOMEONE COULD GET KILLED. I URGE THAT SOME IMPROVED PROC BE IMPLEMENTED. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: RPTR STATES THAT HE DID NOT CONTACT THE TWR REGARDING THE INCIDENT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BUSY. THERE ARE 2 TRAINING SCHOOLS ON THE FIELD AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVITY WITH INEXPERIENCED STUDENT PLTS.

IN PARTICULAR; THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS EXHIBITED BY THE CTLRS HAS DECREASED; INCREASING PLT WORKLOAD. INCIDENTS WHERE THE CTLR HAS HAD TO ASK THE ACFT ON FINAL OR DOWNWIND TO IDENT HIMSELF ARE NOW REGULAR OCCURRENCES. 'MANGLING' OF TAIL NUMBERS OCCURS DAILY. ON ONE FLT THE WEEK BEFORE THIS EVENT; WE WERE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR 3 DIFFERENT TAIL NUMBERS (XA; XB; XC -- ONLY OURS; XA WAS THAT OF AN ACFT IN THE PATTERN). IN THE PAST IN A GIVEN SIT; THE CTLRS WOULD GIVE A PREDICTABLE SET OF OPTIONS IF THEY COULD NOT APPROVE A REQUEST -- NOW WE CAN'T EVEN GUESS. THIS EVENT: WE RPTED #1 FOR TKOF AND REQUESTED TO REMAIN IN THE PATTERN FOR A TOUCH-AND-GO FOLLOWED BY A DEP TO THE N. WE WERE CLRED FOR IMMEDIATE TKOF (L TFC) IN FRONT OF A C172. NORMALLY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF TIME FOR AN IMMEDIATE TKOF; BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE (UNTIL WE SPOKE WITH THE C172 PLT LATER THAT EVENING) THAT HE WAS 'EXPEDITING' FOR A SENECA IN TRAIL AND WAS NOT PLANNING TO SLOW UNTIL SHORT FINAL. HE CLOSED ON US AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO GAR (R TFC). (NO PROB YET.) HE 'MESSED UP' AND FOLLOWED US IN L TFC; SO HE SAW SOME OF WHAT HAPPENED. THE FREQ WAS CONGESTED SO WE WEREN'T ABLE TO COMMUNICATE UNTIL WE WERE ABEAM THE APCH END OF THE RWY. WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW A TOMAHAWK AHEAD ON DOWNWIND. WE WERE INITIALLY UNABLE TO IDENT HIM. WE DID SEE A DARK SHAPE (NO LIGHTS THAT WE COULD SEE) APPARENTLY 'OUTBOUND' ON FINAL WHO WAS WELL BELOW PATTERN ALT. WE ACTUALLY ASKED THE TWR IF OUR TFC WAS STILL OUTBOUND TO CONFIRM THIS. WE WERE OVERTAKING THIS TFC WHO WAS ABOUT 4 MI OUT FROM THE RWY SO WE BEGAN TO SLOW. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TWR TOLD US TO FOLLOW A CESSNA ON A 5 MI FINAL. (IN A SUBSEQUENT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THE CTLR SAID THAT HE TOLD US THAT WE MIGHT BE RESEQUENCED ON THE CESSNA.) IN EITHER CASE WE IDENTED THE CESSNA INBOUND AT THE OM; BUT SINCE THERE WAS NO WAY THAT THE TOMAHAWK COULD TURN INSIDE THE CESSNA; WE DECIDED THAT IF THEY DIDN'T COLLIDE WE WOULD FOLLOW THE TOMAHAWK. THE TOMAHAWK SEEMED TO 'TURN-ON-A-DIME' TO FINAL BEHIND THE CESSNA AND WE MAINTAINED VISUAL CONTACT WITH BOTH ACFT AS WE TURNED FINAL. AT THAT TIME; THE TOMAHAWK AND WE WERE CLRED TO LAND AND TAXI BACK (IN THE PAST CTLRS WOULD GIVE THE OPTION OF DEPARTING THE PATTERN WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY WANTED). BECAUSE OF THE UNEXPECTED CLRNC; I LOOKED OVER TO THE L DOWNWIND TO SEE IF THERE WAS TFC SO THAT WE COULD REQUEST TO LEAVE THE PATTERN RATHER THAN LAND. AT THAT POINT I MUST HAVE LOST THE TOMAHAWK AND REFOCUSED ON THE CESSNA. WE CONTINUED INBOUND; AND ASKED THE CTLR HOW WE COULD SAFELY LEAVE THE PATTERN. HE NEVER REPLIED UNTIL ABOUT 1 MI OUT WHEN WE WERE TOLD TO GAR. THE CTLR HAD NOTICED THAT WE WERE ABOVE AND OVERTAKING THE TOMAHAWK. HE AND ANOTHER CTLR TOLD ME BY TELEPHONE AFTERWARD THAT WE WERE 'NOT THAT CLOSE;' BUT THE TOMAHAWK PLT RPTED IN A TELEPHONE CALL TO THE TWR THAT HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE TREADS ON OUR TIRES. I DID NOT SEE THE TOMAHAWK. I AM DISTURBED BECAUSE THE CONFUSION 'CAUSED' BY THE CTLR; THE SLOWER FLYING TOMAHAWK INVENTING A NEW (NON STANDARD) TFC PATTERN AND THE TIME OF DAY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE ME TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE TFC WITHOUT REALIZING IT. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF THE CTLR OR THE OTHER PLT; BUT STANDARD PROCS WOULD HAVE HELPED ME TO AVOID THIS SIT; WHILE INCREASED VIGILANCE ON MY PART WOULDN'T HAVE HURT EITHER. FORTUNATELY; WE ARE ALL ABLE TO LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. (THE OTHER OCCUPANT OF MY ACFT WAS A PVT PLT WHO HAD JUST REGAINED HIS CURRENCY BY FLYING WITH ME AND I INVITED HIM ALONG WHILE I FLEW TO GIVE MYSELF SOME HANDS-ON FLYING TIME.)",,,,"PA28 AND PA38 HAD NMAC IN BED ARPT TFC PATTERN.",

AT 9 MI SSW OF HANSCOM FIELD; HDG APPROX 030 DEGS; BOS APCH CTL CEASED RADAR SVCS AND ADVISED ME TO CONTACT HANSCOM TWR.

USING THE ARPT DIAGRAM OF THE TERMINAL PROC FOR ORIENTATION (REF 1) PROVIDED FURTHER CONFUSION AS I DID NOT REALIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT N IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE TOP OF THE PAGE. IT IS ALIGNED TO THE L OF THE PAGE. THEREFORE; I EXPECTED TO SEE RWY 5/23 IN A DIFFERENT POS RELATIVE TO THE TWR AND TERMINAL BUILDING THAT WERE VISIBLE TO ME. I AM NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH HANSCOM FIELD; HAVING BEEN THERE ONLY 3 OR 4 TIMES; ALWAYS UNDER IFR GUIDANCE TO THE RWY. NO TERRAIN FEATURES EXIST FOR ORIENTATION SW OF HANSCOM AS IT IS WOODED OVER A LARGE AREA. ADDITIONALLY; NO VOR OR ADF NAV IS PRESENT ON THE FIELD FOR DIRECTIONAL ORIENTATION. BUT A LARGE FACTOR IN ME NOT TURNING N EARLY ON TO ENTER THE TFC PATTERN OF RWY 23 FROM THE W ON R DOWNWIND WAS WORSE THAN EXPECTED PLT FATIGUE. FOR SEVERAL PRECEDING NIGHTS; MINIMAL SLEEP WAS HAD. THERE WAS PRESENT ENOUGH INFO; COMPASS HDG OF 030 DEGS; TO REALIZE THAT I WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CTRLINE FOR R DOWNWIND.

THE TWR CTLR; NOT ANTICIPATING MY ACTUAL POS; INSISTED ON A R DOWNWIND AS PREVIOUSLY CLRED. AT THIS POINT I DETERMINED; IN HASTE; THAT I COULD SQUEEZE BTWN A DEPARTING C152 AND AN IN-TRAIL PIPER WARRIOR. A BETTER PLAN; GIVEN A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT; WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO A 180 DEG TURN OUT OF THE AREA OR JUST ENTER THE L DOWNWIND; THUS NOT REQUIRING A MANEUVER BTWN DEPARTING TFC.

STERLING IS CTLED BY GLIDER OPS -- ESPECIALLY DURING WKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. GLIDERS ARE STREWN ABOUT THE LNDG AND T-OFF AREA AT ALL TIMES. MOST FREQUENTLY; THEY ARE CONGREGATED AT THE APCH END OF RWY 34 (OR RWY 16) ON THE GRASS. TO GET TO THE PAVED RWY 34 DEP VIA TAXIING ON THE TXWY IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS THERE ARE A SCORE OF HUMANS DANGEROUSLY RUNNING ACROSS; BACK AND FORTH AND IN ALL DIRECTIONS DOWN THERE. IN THIS WRITER'S OPINION; A NOTAM SHOULD BE ISSUED SUGGESTING DEPARTING ACFT TAKE OFF ON THE GRASS; IN FRONT OF THE TOW AND GLIDER PLANES; ONCE IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE INTENT FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF. THEN; IMMEDIATELY AFTER TKOF; FLY AWAY FROM THE RWY AT AN ANGLE; AS GLIDERS MIGHT BE APCHING TO LAND AT ANY TIME IN ANY DIRECTION WITHOUT CTL. ON THE DAY STATED ABOVE; A FELLOW CLRING THE WAY FOR A TUG AND GLIDER TO TAKE OFF (BUT NOT YET READY) RAN IN FRONT OF MY PROP AS IF TO SAY HE (WITHOUT A PLANE) HAD THE RWY. I WAITED UNTIL THEY TIED THE GLIDER AND SUBSEQUENTLY THEY TOOK OFF. I MADE A SWEEP OF THE BASE LEG AND FINAL; MADE THE TKOF ANNOUNCEMENT ON 122.9 AND 122.75 AS PEOPLE FREQUENTLY USE THAT FREQ THERE TOO; THEN TOOK OFF FOLLOWING THE C182 TUG WITH GLIDER IN TOW. THEN; AN INTERESTING THING HAPPENED. I BECAME CAUGHT IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE C182 TUG WAKE TURB OF TIP VORTEX. FOR A MOMENT; LATERAL CTL BECAME DIFFICULT AS IT ABRUPTLY ROLLED ME TO THE R; NEAR THE RWY. AT FULL PWR; I WAS QUICKLY OUT OF IT; THEN DECIDED TO PROCEED AT ABOUT A 45 DEG ANGLE DEP FROM THE RWY; ABOUT 3/4 DISTANCE FROM THE APCH END. AT THIS TIME; I NOTED THE TUG AND GLIDER ALSO IN A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL TURN TO THE R; OFF THE DEP END. AS I WAS FASTER; I KEPT MY PLANE LOW; WHILE ACCELERATING AND REMAINING CLR OF THE TUG AND GLIDER. AGAIN; THERE ARE NO NOTAMS AT THE FSS IN BANGOR ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE -- NO RECOMMENDED PATTERN OR GND TAXI NOTAMS (THERE HAS BEEN A NOTAM ABOUT 'TWR LIGHT' OUTAGE (FOR NIGHTS?). IN THE AOPA ARPT DIRECTORY; THERE IS A NOTE THAT GLIDERS USE A R PATTERN; WHILE PWRED PLANES ARE TO USE A NORMAL L PATTERN (PWRED FOR LNDG; I ASSUME). A MENTION OF INTENSE INSTRUCTIONAL AND SOARING FLTS IS ALSO MENTIONED (ASSUMING ONE USES THIS DIRECTORY). CONTRARY TO THIS; ONE WILL FIND GLIDERS COMING IN FROM R AND L PATTERNS AND TUGS AND GLIDERS USING A L PATTERN AFTER TAKING OFF. A WHILE BACK; WHILE ON TKOF ROLL RWY 34; A GLIDER LANDED IN FRONT OF ME IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON RWY 16. ADDITIONALLY; ONE TIME A FELLOW IN A PIPER TOMAHAWK; AFTER ANNOUNCING 'DOWNWIND FOR RWY 34' LANDED NOSE-TO-NOSE ON RWY 16 WHILE I WAS ROLLING OUT ON LNDG ON RWY 34. IN MY OPINION; THERE SHOULD BE AN FAA NOTAM ADVISING PLTS 'SOMETHING' OF THE DANGERS ABOUT PEOPLE ON THE RWY; UNUSUAL TFC PATTERN PROCS. A PUBLISHED DISCRETE FREQ OTHER THAN PLANE-TO-PLANE MULTICOM (AS 122.9 AND 122.75 ARE ALMOST ALWAYS ACTIVE ELSEWHERE; BLOCKING ADVISORIES DURING BUSY TIMES); THEN POSSIBLY A SUGGESTION TO MINIMIZE TIME IN THE TFC PATTERN AND NEAR THE RWY ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE BEEN FLYING IN AND OUT OF STERLING FOR ABOUT 40 YRS; MOSTLY VISITING FRIENDS. THE SIT THERE IS GOING TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND FATALITY.

MY STUDENT TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TURNING AND CLBING TO THE R. THE DASH 8 ACFT TURNED AWAY AND TO THEIR R. DURING OUR CLBOUT MY STUDENT AND I HAD OUR ATTN OUTSIDE THE AIRPLANE. HOWEVER; BECAUSE WE WERE CLBING AND THE DASH 8 WAS DSNDING AT HIGH SPD MY STUDENT WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE OTHER ACFT UNTIL IT WAS IN CLOSE PROX. MY STUDENT'S ACTIONS WERE IMMEDIATE AND DELIBERATE AND WE MADE A STEEP BANK AWAY FROM THE TFC. AT THE CLOSEST POINT I ESTIMATE OUR DISTANCE TO BE 500 FT FROM THE OTHER ACFT. THE DASH 8 SPD AT THE TIME HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY ME TO BE IN EXCESS OF 150 KTS. OUR SPD AT THE TIME WAS BTWN 75 KTS AND 80 KTS. NO TA WAS NOTED BY ME TO HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO US BY THE TWR.

I SAW THE RADAR PLOT LATER AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONLY 3.5 MI BTWN THEM. AS THE ACFT CLBED NWBOUND AND BELIEVING I HAD A CUSHION ON 2 MI I INSTRUCTED THE CENTURION TO RESUME HIS OWN NAV DIRECT TO PUT VOR (A COURSE THAT WOULD CONVERGE WITH THE HEADING OF THE PA31) LEAVING THE ASSIGNED ALT OF THE NAVAJO (8000 FT).

UPON REACHING THE START OF THE TOBIN RTE AT 800 FT AND ABOUT 1 MI FROM XING THE RWY 15R APCH COURSE; JUST WHERE THE TURBOPROPS START MAKING THEIR R TURNS VISUALLY DOWN THE HARBOR FOR RWY 4L; I LOOKED AT MY 1 O'CLOCK POS AND ABOUT 1 MI AND A TURBOPROP WAS MAKING HIS R TURN DOWN THE HARBOR. ALTHOUGH A SURPRISING SIGHT; BECAUSE THE TWR HAD MADE NO MENTION OF THE TFC; NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY. I CONTINUED OUT THE TOBIN RTE XING THE RWY 15R COURSE WITHOUT INCIDENT.

THE TFC WAS ISSUED WITH ACR X INSTRUCTED TO 'STAY ON RWY HDG.' THE PLT RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE HDG 270 DEGS AND ASKED IF THAT WOULD BE OK. AT FIRST THE TRAINEE SAID 270 DEGS WOULD AVOID THE TFC; THEN REALIZED IT WOULD BE TOO CLOSE AND TURNED ACR BACK TO 290 DEGS; THEN RPTED THE TFC IN SIGHT LESS THAN 1/2 MI 'HDG RIGHT AT US AT OUR ALT (4000 FT).' THE PLT QUESTIONED HOW CLOSE THE TFC CAME TO THEM AND ASKED WHAT ALT WE SHOWED ON THE TFC. WE TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO XPONDER; NO ALT. WE TRACKED THE PRIMARY TARGET TO A SMALL ARPT IN NORTHERN MAINE. BEFORE LNDG; THE PLT ASKED BANGOR APCH FOR A XPONDER CHK (HIS FIRST CONTACT WITH ATC SINCE DEPARTING CONNECTICUT). THE PLT CALLED US ON THE PHONE AND ADVISED THAT HE PASSED OVER PWM AT 5500 FT (HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN TOLD THAT '3 AIRLINE PLTS WILL TESTIFY YOU WERE AT 4000 FT'). HE FURTHER SAID HE WAS MONITORING THE ATC FREQ AND 'THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT ME AFTER I SAW THE B727 GO BY.' WHY THE PLT MONITORED THE FREQ AND NEVER CALLED US IS BEYOND ME. WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED AN NMAC AND MAYBE WORSE. IF THE ATC SVC IS THERE; USE IT! IT'S LESS WORKLOAD ON ATC TO TRACK AN ACFT AND GIVE AN ALTIMETER THAN CONSTANTLY BE ISSUING TFC 'TYPE AND ALT UNKNOWN.' I SPOKE WITH THE ACR PLT ON THE PHONE AND TOLD HIM THE PRIMARY TARGET WAS IN AN AREA WHERE THE ONLY ALT HE COULD BE AT; AND BE LEGAL; WAS 1500 FT AND BELOW; BUT I HAD THE TRAINEE ISSUE THE TFC ANYWAY 'BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW.' MY TECHNIQUE; WHICH I RECOMMEND; IS TO ADD PHRASEOLOGY 'NO XPONDER' WHEN MAKING A CALL TO A TCASII EQUIPPED ACFT. THE PLT LIKED THE IDEA BECAUSE THEY (LIKE ME; WHEN I JUMP SEAT) INITIALLY LOOK AT THE TCASII TO BETTER CORRELATE THE TFC RELATIVE TO THE ACFT. ADDING 'NO XPONDER' GETS EVERYONE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT A BLANK TCASII BOX.

I STARTED A DSCNT AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT NASHUA TWR ON 133.2 MHZ BUT WAS UNABLE DUE TO FREQ CONGESTION. I CIRCLED FOR DSCNT OUTSIDE OF NASHUA'S CLASS D AIRSPACE 5 MI TO THE N. I STARTED INBOUND TO THE FIELD AFTER ESTABLISHING COMS WITH ASH TWR AND NOTIFYING THEM OF MY POS 5 MI TO THE N ON A '45 DEG ENTRY TO R DOWNWIND RWY 32.' THE TWR LATER ASKED MY DISTANCE FROM THE FIELD; TO WHICH I RESPONDED '2.5 MI N.' THEY ASSIGNED ME TO 'ENTER L DOWNWIND FOR RWY 32 AND RPT MIDFIELD.' I ACCEPTED THIS CLRNC BUT QUICKLY REALIZED THIS WOULD CAUSE ME TO CROSS THE DEP END OF RWY 32; ABOUT 1 MI OFF THE DEP END; WHERE I COULD SEE ONE ACFT APCHING THE 1200 FT PATTERN ALT AND HAD KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER ACFT DEPARTING. I ATTEMPTED TO RAISE THE TWR TO REQUEST A R DOWNWIND BUT WAS UNABLE DUE TO FREQ CONGESTION. I CONTINUED TOWARD THE ARPT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO RAISE THE TWR. I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE TWR UPON REACHING 'MIDFIELD OF THE R DOWNWIND.' MY APPEARING ON THE R DOWNWIND UPSET THE TWR'S SEQUENCING PLAN OF A TWIN ON THE R DOWNWIND AND SINGLE ENG ACFT ON THE L DOWNWIND. THIS FORCED A TWIN TO FLY A WIDE PATTERN AS IT CAUGHT UP TO ME. I CHOSE TO CONTINUE TO THE R DOWNWIND WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE TWR AFTER ASSESSING THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: 1) CROSS THE EXTENDED CTRLINE TO GET TO THE L DOWNWIND THUS CREATING A CONFLICT WITH DEPARTING ACFT AT THE SAME ALT THAT I WOULD BE XING. 2) CIRCLE 2 MI N OF THE ARPT AT PATTERN ALT WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE (WHILE THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST OPTION FROM A REG POINT OF VIEW; I ASSESSED THIS AS NOT VERY SAFE KNOWING THERE WERE ARRIVING ACFT BEHIND ME). 3) CLBING CIRCLE TO THE N TO DEPART THE AREA. CLBING IN THIS AREA WOULD PUT ME BACK INTO THE CLASS C AIRSPACE OF MHT BEFORE BEING ABLE TO ESTABLISH COM WITH MHT APCH. 4) CONTINUING TOWARD THE R SIDE OF THE RWY; WHERE THERE WAS NO OTHER TFC IN FRONT OF ME WHILE SORTING THINGS OUT WITH THE TWR. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: HIGHER THAN NORMAL APCH SPD DUE TO STEEP DSCNT ANGLE FROM APCH CTL. BEING ASSIGNED AN UNEXPECTED L DOWNWIND ENTRY THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO CROSS THE EXTENDED CTRLINE WITH TFC DEPARTING ALONG CTRLINE AT SAME ALT.

THE TRIGGER ACFT WAS SEEN TO FLY THROUGH THE FINAL FROM L BASE TO THE R DOWNWIND ON TCASII. OBSERVING THE TARGET CLOSURE; I ACCELERATED (FROM THE TWR REQUESTED MINIMUM APCH SPD) IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID CONFLICT. THE TARGET MATCHED MY SPD AND ALT CHANGES EXACTLY THROUGH THE TA. THE DSND RA OCCURRED AT 1100 FT AGL (NOT INCLUDING THE TALL ANTENNA FARM). AT 200 FT SEPARATION 900 FT AGL; THE 'DSND' RA CHANGED TO A LEVEL 'MONITOR VERT SPD' RA. THE EGPWS NEVER TRIGGERED. ON BASE THE TRIGGER ACFT TRIGGERED ANOTHER TA. THE T2 WAS OBSERVED CLRING RWY 29 SHORTLY AFTER MY ACFT. AT NO TIME DID TWR ISSUE AN ADVISORY; WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO DISTRS BY OTHER SMALL ACFT IN THE FULL PATTERN. THE THOUGHT THAT A MIL TRAINING FLT WOULD PERFORM AN UNANNOUNCED UNAUTH INTERCEPT AND FORMATION FLT IN A TFC PATTERN IS UNACCEPTABLE! YET THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THAT CONCLUSION. THE T2 WAS THE ONLY ACFT IN THE PATTERN THAT COULD MATCH THE LJ60 PERFORMANCE. A VISUAL CONFIRMATION COULD NOT BE MADE DUE TO THE TARGET BEING IN THE 5 O'CLOCK POS BLIND SPOT. IF FOR SOME REASON IT WAS A FALSE RA (UNLIKELY!); THEN A DSCNT RA AT 1100 FT AGL WAS HIGHLY DANGEROUS. LUCKILY ENOUGH; THE WX WAS CAVU.

THE FO AND I WATCHED THE TFC AND BOTH COMMENTED ON HOW CLOSE IT LOOKED. AFTER A FEW SECONDS; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT IN ANTICIPATION OF LOWERING THE NOSE. ABOUT THEN; THE TCASII ISSUED AN RA AND I LOWERED THE NOSE MORE. THE OTHER ACFT WENT OVER US L TO R AND A CLR OF CONFLICT WAS HEARD. SOON; THE CTLR ASKED IF WE HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE TFC IN VISUAL CONTACT. THE FO RPTED NO. WE SAW THE TFC COMING AND I STARTED TO REACT BEFORE THE TCASII; BUT IT STILL WAS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. IN OVER 30 YRS OF FLYING LARGE ACFT; THIS IS A FIRST. I DON'T THINK IT IS SAFE TO ALLOW VISUAL SEPARATION FOR JET ACFT. IT IS TOO HARD TO JUDGE THE SEPARATION AND CLOSURE RATES. I WILL NOT ACCEPT ONE AGAIN AND THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION ON BOTH AIRPLANES THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER WILL DO; BUT YOU DON'T.

THE CAPT DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND I LOOKED AT THE RJ AGAIN AND HE WAS STILL TURNING INTO US. THE CAPT WAS LOWERING THE NOSE AS THE RJ FLEW BEHIND US. I GUESSED THE DISTANCE TO BE AROUND 800 FT. AS THE RJ WAS PASSING BEHIND; WE GOT A MOMENTARY 'DSND' RA. A FEW MOMENTS LATER; CTR CALLED AND ASKED IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE MAINTAINING A VISUAL WITH THE RJ AND I SAID NO. I FEEL IT WAS HARD TO JUDGE CLOSURE IN OUR CLB AND NEXT TIME I WOULD NOT CALL VISUAL ON THE TFC. I THINK THE RJ WAS TURNING TO PASS BEHIND US; BUT DID NOT REALIZE HE WAS CLOSING THE DISTANCE BTWN US.

I THINK FROM HIS REPLIES ON THE RADIO AFTER THE INCIDENT; THAT HE; TOO; KNEW IT WAS A CLOSE ENCOUNTER. TCASII TRAINING PAID OFF. FOLLOW THE COMMANDS. THE FIRST THING THAT FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND AS THE TCASII COMMANDED ONE DIRECTION AND THE CTLR DIRECTED ANOTHER; WAS THE MID AIR IN GERMANY LAST YR. MY PNF DID A GREAT JOB ON VISUALLY ACQUIRING THE TFC; AND CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING THE MISS DISTANCE THROUGH GOOD VERBAL DIRECTIONS. HE WAS PREPARED TO TAKE THE EVASIVE ACTION VISUALLY IF I HAD NOT DONE SO; AND I HAD NOT VERBALIZED MY ACTIONS TO HIM AT THE GIVEN MOMENT. HIS HANDS WERE 'RESTING' ON THE YOKE. AS WE APCHED BED; ON THE EXTENDED R BASE TO RWY 23. WE FLEW RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF A MOONEY THAT WAS ON THE R DOWNWIND TO RWY 23. THE ATC TWR CTLR WAS OVERLOADED WITH DEPS; ARRS; AND VFR PATTERNS. WE WERE ADVISED BY TWR OF THE TFC AT THE LAST MIN AND AVOIDED THAT CONFLICT VISUALLY; WITH THE AID OF TCASII TFC CALL.

I DECIDED TO LET MY STUDENT PICK THE BEST FIELD AND POINTS FOR THE GND REFERENCE MANEUVERS WE WOULD BE PRACTICING. AFTER CIRCLING AROUND OUR POINT ABOUT 4 TIMES WE NOTICED A C172 IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO US THAT WAS MANEUVERING TO FOLLOW OUR FLT PATH. ONE TIME I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO READ THE TAIL NUMBERS AND SAW THE LAST TWO DIGITS WERE 'XX.' I KNEW THAT THIS WAS A STATE POLICE ACFT AT THAT POINT. I THEN THOUGHT THAT THE PLT WAS JUST TO CHK US OUT AND POSSIBLY LEAVE AFTER THEY DETERMINED THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING GND REFERENCE MANEUVERS. REMEMBERING THE ACFT INTERCEPT PROCS; I MONITORED 121.5. I DID NOT HEAR ANY TRANSMISSION TO OUR ACFT IN ANY FORM. THIS LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE FINE. WE THEN DECIDED TO PRACTICE S-TURNS ACROSS RAILROAD TRACKS THAT RUN N TO S. DURING THE MANEUVERING; I WAS SCANNING FOR OTHER TFC LIKE ALWAYS; BUT I COULD NOT SEE THE C172 THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY NEAR ME. AFTER TURNING AGAIN; I SAW THAT HE WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WITHOUT A TURN.

I PARKED ON THE RAMP AND WAITED FOR THE C172 WHO FOLLOWED ME IN AND WE BOTH SHUT DOWN AND TALKED. I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN THAT I DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING ON 121.5 WHICH WOULD HAVE HELPED IF THEY DID WANT ME TO LAND. ANOTHER CONCERN WAS THAT THE ACFT MARKINGS WERE TOUGH TO TELL IF IT WAS A STATE POLICE ACFT. THE OFFICER ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF OUR ACFT TO A RESERVOIR. ON THE SECTIONAL IT BASICALLY LOOKED LIKE A SMALL LAKE; AND FROM THE AIR; IT WAS THE SAME THING. THEREFORE; OUR ENCOUNTER MAY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A TARGET OF INTEREST BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

THIS WAS THE CONFIGN AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. I HAD BEEN ON THE POS FOR 11 MINS WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. I WAS WORKING 8 ACFT; WHICH WERE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE APCH CTL AIRSPACE. ACFT #1 WAS AN IFR RWY 1 DEP FROM BURLINGTON ARPT (BTV); INITIALLY ASSIGNED RWY HEADING BY THE TWR. THE CTLR PRIOR TO MYSELF ISSUED A 100 DEG HDG; FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY A 120 DEG HDG FOR TFC INBOUND TO THE ARPT FROM THE S. THE ACFT WAS ASSIGNED 7000 FT. WHEN THE TFC WAS NO FACTOR; I ISSUED A 160 DEG HDG WITH INSTRUCTION TO PROCEED DIRECT TO THE LEBANON (LEB) VORTAC WHEN ABLE. THIS ACFT WAS GPS-EQUIPPED; SO THE TIME FRAME FOR THE ACFT TO HAVE BEEN FLYING THE 160 DEG HDG SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINIMAL. ACFT #2 WAS AN IFR ARR TO BTV FROM THE S (NOT THE ORIGINAL TFC FOR ACFT #1). ACFT #2 WAS LEVEL AT 7000 FT. ACFT #2 CAME ON FREQ WITH A VERY WEAK RADIO; OF WHICH I ADVISED THE PLT. I ALSO ADVISED ACFT #2 TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 33. SEVERAL MINS AFTER INITIAL CONTACT; ACFT #2 REQUESTED AN ILS/DME APCH TO RWY 33. I ISSUED A 070 DEG HDG TO THE RWY 33 LOC. I THEN TENDED TO OTHER HIGHER PRIORITY DUTIES; INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF MANDATORY TA'S TO VFR ACFT LOCATED WITHIN THE BTV CLASS C AIRSPACE AND ASSOCIATED OUTER AREA. AT THIS TIME; I DID NOT BELIEVE THAT ACFT #1 AND ACFT #2 WOULD BECOME FACTORS FOR EACH OTHER. WHEN I RETURNED MY ATTN TO ACFT #2 FOR THE TURN TO FINAL; I FIRST NOTICED THE ACFT WAS A BIT TOO CLOSE TO THE FIX FROM WHERE THE APCH COMMENCED AND WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE A VECTOR TO WIDEN THE ACFT PATH. I NOTICED THE PROX OF ACFT #1 AND IMMEDIATELY ISSUED A DSCNT INSTRUCTION TO ACFT #2. AT THIS TIME; THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF SEPARATION BTWN THE ACFT; SO THE ACTION TAKEN WAS TO MITIGATE THE SEPARATION LOSS. I WAS FRANKLY SURPRISED BY THE PROX OF THE 2 ACFT. THE REPLAY OF THE RADAR DATA INDICATED THE ACFT WAS TRACKING NEARLY DUE S FOR SEVERAL MI; COMING MUCH CLOSER TO THE RWY 33 LOC THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. IN RETROSPECT; ISSUING A DSCNT TO ACFT #2 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE INITIAL VECTOR TO THE LOC WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRUDENT MOVE AND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE PREVENTED THE LOSS OF SEPARATION. I HAVE BEEN FACED WITH SIMILAR SITS AND IN MOST CASES; WOULD HAVE GIVEN BOTH CTL INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. I AM UNABLE TO PINPOINT WHY I DID NOT DO THAT IN THIS INSTANCE; BUT IT IS POSSIBLE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE WEAK RADIO OR A HIGHER PRIORITY DUTY. OTHER POINTS: 1) THERE WERE AT LEAST 4 OTHER CTLR PERSONNEL IN THE TRACON AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT; INCLUDING ONE OPS SUPVR. MOST OF THESE PERSONNEL WERE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION AT THE SUPVR'S DESK. THE ARR DATA CTLR; WHO ORDINARILY WOULD BE SEATED ADJACENT TO THE ARR RADAR POS; WAS NOT THERE BUT WAS NEAR THE SUPVR'S DESK. IF AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD BEEN WATCHING A RADAR SCOPE; THEN; MORE THAN LIKELY; THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. 2) THE BUILT-IN CONFLICT ALERT (CA) PROBE OF THE ARTS IIE EQUIP; WHILE PROBABLY FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED; WAS TOTALLY USELESS IN THIS INSTANCE TO PREVENT A LOSS OF SEPARATION. THE CA DIDN'T SOUND UNTIL WELL AFTER I REALIZED THE LOSS OF SEPARATION WAS OCCURRING. WHEN THE CA SOUNDED; THE ACFT TARGETS WERE NEARLY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WITH ALREADY INCREASING SEPARATION. INDEED; THE CTLR'S DEFINITION FOR 'CA' IS 'COMING APART.' A MORE USEFUL TOOL WOULD BE A WARNING WELL PRIOR TO THE LOSS OF SEPARATION OCCURRING. THAT IS; A PROBE THAT EXTENDS 5-10 MI AHEAD OF THE ACFT. WHILE I CAN BLAME NO ONE BUT MYSELF FOR THIS OCCURRENCE; I CAN'T HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT WITH JUST 1 OR 2 FACTORS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT; THE INCIDENT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED.",,,,"BTV CTLR EXPERIENCED LOSS OF SEPARATION BTWN ARR AND DEP TFC.",

HE DID NOT MAKE THE CALLOUT; SO I PROMPTED HIM WITH 'GAR; TOGA.' HE RESPONDED BY ESTABLISHING A CLB ATTITUDE AND PUSHED THE THRUST LEVERS FORWARD. WE BOTH FAILED TO VERIFY THAT TOGA WAS ANUNCIATED ON THE FLT MODE ANNUNCIATOR. I WAS LOOKING AT THE FLAP HANDLE AND PROMPTING HIM TO CALL FOR GAR FLAPS; WHICH HE HAD FAILED TO DO. THE FO CONTENDS THAT HE DID INDEED SELECT TOGA WITH THE THRUST LEVERS. I STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT GAR MODE WAS NOT ACHIEVED BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO SELECT TOGA WITH THE THRUST LEVERS. OUR (WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON 'MY') FAILURE TO VERIFY THAT TOGA HAD BEEN ACHIEVED WAS AS LARGE A FACTOR AS THE DELAY IN THE TWR INSTRUCTING THE RJ TO TURN. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFO: THE CAPT STATED THAT AS HE WAS DETERMINING THE REASON FOR THE MASTER CAUTION LIGHT; THE FO WAS INITIATING A TURN TO AVOID THE DEPARTING ERJ-135 XING IN FRONT OF THEM. IT WAS IN THE EVASIVE MANEUVER THAT ATC ASKED IF THEY WERE PROVIDING VISUAL SEPARATION FROM THE ERJ-135.

AS DIRECTED IN OUR NEW PROCS; WE WERE NAVING VIA LNAV IN A -300; SO BOTH OF OUR HSI SELECTOR SWITCHES WERE IN NAV. I DO NOT RECALL WHAT WAS SET IN OUR MANUAL VOR WINDOWS. BASED ON MY PREVIOUS HABITS; IM FAIRLY CERTAIN I HAD THE LOC FREQ FOR RWY 17 AT MHT SET IN MINE; SINCE THATS THE APCH I WAS PLANNING. PASSING FL190 ON PROFILE; THE ACFT BEGAN A R-HAND TURN USING 15-20 DEGS OF BANK. AT THE TIME; I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD; BUT I WAS MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON CALLING FOR THE DSCNT CHKLIST. AS THE TURN CONTINUED AND THE BANK INCREASED; I QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THE CHKLIST AND DEVOTED MY FULL ATTN TO WHERE THE ACFT WAS GOING. BASED ON THE WAY WE WERE APCHING EEN; I HAD EXPECTED A SLIGHT R TURN. HOWEVER; THE EXTENT OF THE TURN BEING CONDUCTED DIDNT SEEM RIGHT. I CHKED THE SCOREBOARD AND CONFIRMED LNAV WAS STILL ENGAGED -- IT WAS. I THEN LOOKED AT THE LEGS PAGE -- STILL SHOWED EEN-MHT ALTHOUGH THE HDGS WERE DIFFERENT THAN WHERE WE WERE TURNING. I QUICKLY TRIED TO XCHK RAW DATA; BUT WE DIDNT HAVE EEN IN EITHER WINDOW; SO IT TOOK A MOMENT TO FIND THE FREQ AND DIAL IT IN. AS I WAS DOING ALL THIS; I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT AND BEGAN A L-HAND TURN BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL COURSE. (I WOULD ESTIMATE THE ACFT HAD TURNED ABOUT 45 DEGS TO THE R BY THE TIME I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPLT.) DURING THE L-HAND TURN; I LOOKED BACK DOWN AT THE FMS AND NOTICED IT WAS BLANK WITH FMC FAIL DISPLAYED. ABOUT THIS TIME; ZBW BEGAN INQUIRING ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING. BOSTON GAVE US A CLRNC TO TURN L TO 020 DEGS AND TO MAINTAIN 16000 FT. AT THIS TIME; WE WERE ALREADY BELOW 16000 FT AND THE CAPT ASKED IF THEY WANTED US TO CLB BACK UP. BOSTON SAID AFFIRMATIVE AND SO I CLBED THE ACFT AND LEVELED AT 16000 FT AND ROLLED OUT ON THE 020 DEG HDG. I ASKED THE CAPT TO DO THE DSCNT CHKLIST TO GET OUR ALTIMETERS SET. DURING THIS TIME; BOSTON WAS ALSO GIVING CTL INSTRUCTIONS TO AT LEAST 1 OTHER ACFT WHO I PERCEIVED WE HAD BECOME IN CONFLICT WITH. AFTER A COUPLE MORE HDG AND ALT CHANGES; WE WERE GIVEN DIRECT MHT AGAIN. DURING ALL THE TALKING ON THE RADIO; WE WERE TRYING TO DO THE CHALLENGE AND RESPONSE CHKLIST. AT SOME POINT; ATC CALLED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS SORTED OUT AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO PROB. AS YOU MIGHT GUESS; THIS IS MY BEST RECOLLECTION OF THE EVENTS WHICH TRANSPIRED. IT ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND AT A SIGNIFICANT POINT IN THE FLT WHEN WE WERE DSNDING QUICKLY AND TRANSITIONING THROUGH FL180. LESSONS LEARNED: WELL; FOR ONE THING; I DONT LIKE THE NEW LNAV GUIDANCE. HAD WE BEEN FLYING THIS SAME FLT 2 WKS AGO; I HAVE NO DOUBT THE PLT MONITORING WOULD HAVE HAD THE APPROPRIATE NAVAID TUNED UP AND WHEN THE TURN STARTED; I COULD HAVE KNOWN IMMEDIATELY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND MADE THE APPROPRIATE CORRECTION RIGHT AWAY. I ALSO THINK THE NEW POLICY OF NOT HAVING SILENT CHKLISTS IS FLAWED AS WELL. ITS DARK AND IM TRYING TO HAND FLY THE ACFT TO AVOID A TFC CONFLICT AND IM HAVING TO READ AND RESPOND TO A NEW CHKLIST -- NOT GOOD. OF COURSE; I WAS FLYING AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT. MY CRITICISM OF THE NEW PROCS IS THEY LED ME DOWN THE PRIMROSE PATH TO A STATE OF REDUCED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. MY CRITICISM ALSO APPLIES TO THE NEW CLB CHK. DURING A VERY BUSY PHASE OF FLT; WE HAVE TO DIVERT OUR ATTN FROM FLYING THE ACFT TO PROVIDE AURAL RESPONSES TO ANOTHER GUY READING A CHKLIST. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 615900: THINKING BACK ON IT; I THINK THE NEW PROCS SET US UP FOR THAT CONFLICT. FIRST WE WERE BOTH IN NAV; WHICH I DISAGREE WITH. IN THE -300 I THINK THE PLT MONITORING NEEDS TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THE FLT. THATS TOUGH TO DO ON THE DSCNT PAGE WITH BOTH IN NAV. SECONDLY; WE WERE BOTH OUT OF THE LOOP INITIALLY BECAUSE WE WERE CHALLENGING AND RESPONDING TO THE DSCNT CHKLIST. THEREFORE; BOTH PLTS WERE DISTR FROM FLYING RATHER THAN 1 PLT. I THINK THAT CHKLIST AND THE CLBCHKLIST NEED TO BE ADJUSTED; OR CHANGED TO SILENT COMPLETION. WE HAD AN FMC ABNORMALITY THAT NEEDED TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH TO COMPLETION. THAT IS A LOT OF DISTRS DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SOME OF IT WAS SELF-IMPOSED DUE TO THE NEW PROCS.",,,,"A B737-300 CREW HAD A TRACK DEV IN ZBW CLASS E AIRSPACE.",

THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL INTO A RIVER AT APPROX 6.5 DME SW OF BOS ARPT. WE WENT DIRECTLY TO THIS SCENE FROM A PREVIOUS STORY. WE THEN VIDEOTAPED THE OIL SPILL AND DID A LIVE RPT ON TV. I THEN TOLD THE STATION THAT WE WERE LEAVING FOR BEVERLY ARPT FOR FUEL. NEXT; I CALLED BOSTON SKYWAYS (BOS TWR FOR BOS CLASS B VFR HELI AND FIXED WING ACFT) FOR CLRNC TO GO TO BEVERLY ARPT.

AS SOON AS I ACKNOWLEDGED THE RESTR; THE TV STATION CALLED ME ON THE FM RADIO AND ASKED WHAT THE TURNAROUND TIME WOULD BE TO REFUEL AND GO BACK TO THE OIL SPILL. I SAID APPROX 45 MINS TO 1 HR. AS I CONTINUED TO DSND AND FLY NE; THE CTLR ASKED ME IF I HAD A B737 AT MY 2 O'CLOCK POS IN SIGHT. I SAID NO. I LEVELED THE HELI AT 500 FT APPROX 1 1/2 MI PRIOR TO XING THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE AND CONTINUED TOWARD GRAVES.

WHEN WELL E OF THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE; THE CTLR SAID I COULD CLB TO 1000 FT ENRTE TO BEVERLY ARPT. HERE IS MY DILEMMA: AFTER LNDG AT BEVERLY ARPT; I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE VERBIAGE THE CTLR USED. I AM 90% CERTAIN THAT HE SAID HE NEEDED ME AT 500 FT PRIOR OR BEFORE XING THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE. HOWEVER; AFTER THINKING ABOUT IT; I HAVE SOME QUESTION THAT HE MAY HAVE SAID HE NEEDED ME AT 500 FT WHILE 'ENRTE' FOR PASSING UNDER THE RWY 33 APCH COURSE -- WHICH; IF THAT WERE TRUE; I SHOULD HAVE DSNDED OVER MY LOCATION TO 500 FT AND THEN PROCEEDED ON COURSE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS; ALTHOUGH THE CTLR NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT INDICATED THERE WAS CONCERN OR A PROB AND THE FLT WAS FINE; I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECALL EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED AND AFTER LNDG; I COULD NOT. I BELIEVE I MADE THE MISTAKE IN NOT GIVING 100% ATTN TO ATC INSTRUCTIONS. WHEN FLYING A MULTI-TASK JOB; IE; ENG; EMS; PWR LINES; LIFT WORK; ETC; THERE CAN BE MANY DISTRS FROM THE CUSTOMER WHILE YOU ARE FLYING THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO WITH THE IMMEDIATE JOB OF FLYING THE ACFT. IN THE FUTURE; I WILL LOCK OUT THE FM RADIOS TO THE TV STATION WHILE RECEIVING A CLRNC OR ATC INSTRUCTIONS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ATC TAKE PRIORITY.

THIS CONTACT THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED INTO A SOLID DIAMOND; INDICATING LESS THAN 6 MI LATERAL DISTANCE AND WITHIN 1200 FT ALT. BECAUSE OF THE L TURN TOWARD PVD; WAS BELLY UP TO THE TFC; CONVERGING (DUE TO TURN RADIUS); AND APCHING ITS ALT. ROLLING OUT TO GAIN VISUAL CONTACT WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE RATE OF LATERAL CLOSURE.

THE ZBW CTLR THEN HANDED ACR X OFF TO BOS APCH; WHICH VECTORED US FOR AN ILS RWY 4R. BASED ON OTHER TFC OBSERVED AFTER THE HDOF; IT DID NOT APPEAR TO THE FLT CREW THAT THE VECTORING OVER PVD WAS DRIVEN BY A NEED TO ATTAIN SPACING WITH OTHER ACFT INBOUND TO BOS AHEAD OF US. A NORMAL APCH AND LNDG WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ACCOMPLISHED. ACR X FLT REGULARLY RECEIVES EXCELLENT SVC FROM ZBW. THIS INCIDENT WAS AN ABERRATION; ALBEIT A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ONE. HOPEFULLY; IT WILL SERVE AS A LESSON LEARNED FOR THE FLT CREW AND CTLR. HOWEVER; IT IS ALSO A WARNING OF A LARGER PROB THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BY FAA AND THE INDUSTRY.

THE RADAR CTLR APPEARED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO TFC; HOWEVER; THEIR OPERATIONAL APPLICATION HAD INCLUDED A NUMBER OF MODIFIED AND RESCINDED CLRNCS NECESSARY TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION BTWN TFC WITHIN THEIR AREA OF JURISDICTION; THESE MODIFIED CLRNCS INDICATED A LACK OF TFC AWARENESS AND PREPLANNING. THE 2 ACFT PROMPTING THIS RPT WERE BOSTON DEPS BEING HANDLED NORMALLY BY BOSTON DEP CTL (NOW BCT; BOSTON CONSOLIDATED TRACON). AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT MY ATTN AS AN ASSOCIATE CTLR HAD BEEN ON AN A320 ENRTE TO JFK VIA AN AMENDED ROUTING THAT PLACED THE ACFT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION TFC SITS WITH VARIOUS SECTOR TFC FLOWS; AS WELL AS; REQUIRING OBSERVATION AND COORD WITH THE SECTOR ABOVE BOSOX FOR SEQUENCING WITH OTHER JFK TFC. PLANNING THE A320 SEQUENCING REQUIRED THAT I MOMENTARILY STAND AND OBSERVE POS R46 (BOSTON); A SECTOR TO OUR R; AND PHYSICALLY LOOK AT THEIR TFC; SINCE ASKING THE 47 RADAR CTLR TO QUICK LOOK POS 46 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DISTRACTING AT THAT MOMENT; AND SECTOR 46 WAS TOO BUSY TO DISCUSS OR VIEW THE A320'S PRESENT POS AND PROJECTED COURSE.

ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS THIS NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR HAS REQUIRED THE OVERSIGHT AND INTERVENTION OF OTHER CTLRS TO ENSURE STANDARD SEPARATION WAS MAINTAINED; IN ADDITION; CRITICAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS ROUTINE HOLDING AND METERING HAVE BECOME TOO COMPLEX FOR THE CTLR TO HANDLE RESULTING IN DISORGANIZED AND DANGEROUS TFC SITS. ANOTHER NEWLY CERTIFIED CTLR IN THE SAME AREA OF SPECIALTY HAS HAD ONE OPERROR AS A RESULT OF CTLR ERROR; AND HAS ALSO REQUIRED THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN ORDER AND SEPARATION DURING ROUTINE TFC SITS.

DURING THE TIME THAT WE INITIATED OUR DSCNT UNTIL WE WERE LEVEL AT 8000 FT; THE FREQ WAS ABSOLUTELY SILENT. THE NEXT RADIO CALL WAS FROM A DIFFERENT APCH CTLR WHO HAD IMMEDIATELY STEPPED IN TO RELIEVE THE CTLR WHO HAD GIVEN US THE CLB TO 7000 FT AND 14000 FT AND ORDERED US TO DSND. THE NEW CTLR SUBSEQUENTLY CLBED US TO 14000 FT AND HANDED US OFF TO ZBW ON FREQ 128.2. WE WERE NOT WITH CTR FOR 5 MINS WHEN THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION OCCURRED: BOSTON CTR: 'ACR Y; BOSTON TRACON WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU GET ON THE GND.' ME: 'I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO THEM; TOO; DO YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER?' THIS NEAR COLLISION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY REQUIRING ALL PART 121 CARRIERS TO HAVE TCASII. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD; I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A 'MONITOR VERT SPD' OR A 'DSND; DSND' COMMAND SHORTLY AFTER PASSING 8000 FT. BECAUSE THE ACFT ONLY HAD TCASI; THERE WAS NO COMMAND GIVEN. ADDITIONALLY; THE INSTALLED TCAS UNIT FAILED TO EVEN CALL 'TFC; 'TFC' EVEN THOUGHT IT PASSED THE SELF-TEST BEFORE AND AFTER THE INCIDENT.

ALSO; I COULD SEE ALTHOUGH IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE; THE FALCON WOULD PASS UNDER US AS IT DID. I FEEL THE PROB ROSE AS A RESULT OF THE FALCON EITHER DECIDING TO FLY OVER OUR WELL KNOWN (21 YRS) GLIDER AREA OR WAS ROUTED THERE BY CAPE APCH. WE WERE ONLY ONE MILE NE OFF OF OUR FIELD (2B1).

THIS WAS THE FIRST LEG OF A 2-LEG TRIP AND BOTH PLTS HAD AN ADEQUATE REST PERIOD PRIOR TO THE FLT. CURRENT WX AT NEW HAVEN WAS WINDS 210 DEGS AT 6 KTS; CLR SKIES AND A RPTED VISIBILITY OF 6 NM IN HAZE. UPON CHKING IN WITH NEW YORK APCH; WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT A VISUAL APCH TO RWY 20. NEARING THE NEW HAVEN AREA WE WERE AT 3000 FT AND ON A HDG OF 150 DEGS ASSIGNED AND TOLD TO RPT THE ARPT IN SIGHT. THE CTLR STATED THAT THIS HDG WOULD GIVE US A 2-3 MI FINAL. APPROX 3 MI FROM THE ARPT; WE TOLD NEW YORK THAT WE HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT. NEW YORK APCH ACKNOWLEDGED CLRED US FOR THE VISUAL APCH AND INSTRUCTED US TO SWITCH FREQS TO NEW HAVEN TWR. AFTER TRYING TO CHK IN WITH TWR ON THE NEW YORK APCH FREQ (CREW FAILED TO CHANGE TO TWR FREQ). WE THEN CHKED IN WITH NEW HAVEN TWR. WE WERE NOW APPROX 2 NM NW OF THE ARPT ON A SLIGHT R DOGLEG TO FINAL. THE TWR OPERATOR INITIALLY ASKED US FOR OUR POS AND THEN SAID THAT HE HAD US IN SIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME AS OUR ARR; 2 LIGHT SINGLE ENG ACFT WERE IN A L-HAND PATTERN MAKING TOUCH-AND-GO APCHS TO RWY 20. ONE AIRPLANE; A WARRIOR (I BELIEVE) WAS TURNING L BASE TO FINAL AS WE APCHED THE ARPT. THE TWR CTLR TOLD THE WARRIOR TO MAKER A L 360 DEG TURN FOR TFC. UPON SIGHTING THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT; WE LEVELED OFF OUR DSCNT AT 1000 FT MSL AWAITING LNDG CLRNC. ONCE THE WARRIOR BEGAN HIS L 360 DEG TURN; WE RECEIVED AN RA 'MONITOR VERT SPD.' WE CONTINUED TO FLY TOWARDS THE RWY AT 1000 FT MSL; WITHIN THE GREEN ARC CALLED FOR BY THE RA. WHEN WE RECEIVED OUR CLRNC TO LAND; WE WERE NOT IN A POS TO MAKE A SAFE LNDG SO WE REQUESTED A GAR. THE TWR CLRED US FOR A R TFC PATTERN AND WE CAME AROUND AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. FROM THE COCKPIT; THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS CONFLICT APPEAR TO BE: 1) WX. THE HAZE PREVENTED US FROM PICKING UP THE ARPT UNTIL LATER THAN NORMAL; LEADING TO A LATE HDOF FROM NEW YORK APCH TO NEW HAVEN TWR. 2) INITIAL CONFUSION FROM NEW HAVEN TWR REGARDING OUR LOCATION. WHEN CHKING IN; WE ONLY PROVIDED OUR CALL SIGN WITH NO LOCATION GIVEN; ASSUMING THAT NEW YORK APCH HAD COORD THE IFR HDOF. THIS ADDED TO THE CONFUSION OF INTEGRATING OUR IFR ARR WITH THE VFR TFC IN THE PATTERN. OUR 'LATE ARR' INTO THE TFC PATTERN MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ON THE CTLR TO SEQUENCE 2 ACFT ON SHORT APCH TO THE SAME RWY. THE RA 'MONITOR VERT SPD' ONCE AGAIN PROVES THE INCREDIBLE VALUE OF TCAS. ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT A SIMILAR OUTCOME WOULD HAVE RESULTED THROUGH SEE AND AVOID; THE RA MADE THE RESOLUTION MUCH LESS STRESSFUL AND SAFER.",,,,"FALCON DA50 HAS A TCAS RA DURING VISUAL APCH TO HVN.",

I ASKED MY FO TO TURN OFF THE COCKPIT AUX HEATER; AS IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY. HE APPARENTLY MISTAKENLY TURNED OFF THE 'CABIN AIR' SWITCH RATHER THAN THE COCKPIT AUX HEATER. IN LEAR JETS; THE 'CABIN AIR' SWITCH IS THE MASTER CTL SWITCH FOR THE PRESSURIZATION SYS. UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS; IT ALLOWS ENG BLEED AIR INTO THE PRESSURIZATION SYS TO CTL THE CABIN PRESSURE OF THE ACFT IN NORMAL OP. WITH THE CABIN AIR SWITCH 'OFF;' ENG BLEED AIR IS NOT ALLOWED TO PRESSURIZE THE CABIN AND NORMAL PRESSURIZATION IS LOST. THE RESULT OF THE FO'S INADVERTENT DEACTIVATION OF THE 'CABIN AIR' SYS WAS TO DEPRESSURIZE OUR CABIN. THE OUTFLOW VALVES WOULD CLOSE TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE EXISTING PRESSURE BUT THIS WOULD BE; AND WAS; ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX. AS NO NEW BLEED AIR WAS ALLOWED TO PRESSURIZE THE ACFT; PRESSURIZATION GRADUALLY LEAKED OUT AND OUR CABIN ALT ROSE TO ABOVE 10000 FT. ABOVE 10000 FT A NUMBER OF THINGS OCCUR. FIRST A CABIN ALT WARNING SOUNDS (AND ILLUMINATES A CAUTION ADVISORY) AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE PRESSURIZATION SYS ATTEMPTS TO CTL THE CABIN ALT BY SWITCHING INTO AN EMER MODE. IN THIS MODE; THE BLEED VALVES TRIP OPEN AND HOT; UNMODULATED; HIGH PRESSURE AIR IS PUMPED DIRECTLY INTO THE CABIN. THIS STOPS PRESSURE LOSS; BUT IS VERY NOISY AND QUITE HOT. THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AURAL WARNING (UNSILENCEABLE) WAS ALSO CONTINUING TO SOUND MAKING COMS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. (THE COMBINATION OF AURAL WARNING AND HIGH PRESSURE AIR RUSHING INTO THE COCKPIT IS DEAFENING.) AT THIS POINT; I ELECTED TO BEGIN A DSCNT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ASSOCIATED EMER PROC. I ADVISED ATC THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING PRESSURIZATION PROBS AND NEEDED TO DSND TO BELOW 10000 FT. DUE TO THE NOISE IN THE COCKPIT; I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR ATC'S RESPONSE. WE HAD ONLY DSNDED A FEW FT WHEN I NOTICED A TCAS TARGET IN FRONT OF AND BELOW OUR ACFT. I OBTAINED A VISUAL ON THE TFC (A B757) WHICH WAS XING R TO L AND BELOW OUR ACFT. I IMMEDIATELY LEVELED OFF AND TURNED SLIGHTLY TO THE R TO INCREASE THE OFFSET. OUR TCAS ONLY SHOWED THE POS AND ALT OF THE B757 AND ITS STATUS NEVER ELEVATED TO AN ALERT OR RA. AFTER THE B757 WAS WELL CLR TO OUR L; I CONTINUED THE DSCNT TO 8500 FT WHERE I WAS ABLE TO RESET THE EMER AIR TRIP AND REGAIN CTL OF THE ACFT PRESSURIZATION.

I CLBED TO 7500 FT; BUT DECIDED THE WINDS WERE BETTER LOWER; SO I RETURNED TO 5500 FT MSL. I FOLLOWED THE SAME HDG FOR 2.5 HRS AND WAS IN CONSTANT COMS WITH ATC (FROM STATION-TO-STATION) UNTIL MOMENTS BEFORE THIS INCIDENT TOOK PLACE. I CLRLY RECALL TALKING WITH ALBANY AND THEY HANDED ME OFF TO BRADLEY. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CONTACTED BRADLEY ATC. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT MY GPS AND SEEING THAT I WAS 76 NM FROM PVD; I TUNED-IN PVD APCH; TWR AND ATIS TO DETERMINE I SHOULD EXPECT AS AN APCH TO HELP PVD WITH LNDG SEQUENCING. IT WAS AT THIS TIME I SAW SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKIES AHEAD OF ME. IT WAS ABOUT 10-15 DEGS TO THE L OF MY HDG (OF APPROX 115 DEGS); ABOUT 1/2 MI AHEAD AND SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN MY ALT. I QUICKLY REALIZED IT WAS A PARACHUTE JUMPER. HE HAD AN OPEN CANOPY AND WAS NOW DOING A TWIST/TURN MANEUVER TO FURTHER INCREASE THE DISTANCE AND PATH ANGLE BTWN HIMSELF AND ME. RECOGNIZING I HAD WANDERED INTO AN ACTIVE DROP ZONE AND FEARING OTHER JUMPERS MAY BE ABOVE ME IN BLIND SPOTS; SEEING THE CLR PATH AHEAD OF ME AND A GENEROUS HIGH AND WIDE 'TUNNEL OF AIRSPACE' IN FRONT OF ME; I DECIDED TO MAKE A SLIGHT (1 OR 2 DEG) VEER TO MY R (AWAY FROM THE JUMPER) AND CONTINUE A FORWARD; STRAIGHT AND LEVEL EXIT OUT OF THE JUMP ZONE WHILE SITTING FAR FORWARD IN MY SEAT TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE; UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW OF THE CLR AREA AHEAD OF ME. I FELT IF I HAD MADE SUDDEN; DRAMATIC; EVASIVE MANEUVERS IN THE JUMP ZONE TO AVOID THE ONE JUMPER WHO I COULD CLRLY SEE; I WOULD HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE RISK TO OTHER JUMPERS HAD THEY BEEN IN THE SAME AIRSPACE. I FELT A STEADY; STRAIGHT AND LEVEL EXIT FROM THE JUMP ZONE WAS THE BEST AND SAFEST SITUATION. AT THIS TIME THE CESSNA CARAVAN 208B (JUMP PLANE) WAS APPROX 1000-2000 FT ABOVE ME AND PERFORMING A VERY STEEP TURN. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW HE WAS FLYING FROM R TO L. MOMENTS LATER; WHILE I WAS MAKING MY EXIT OUT OF THE JUMP ZONE THIS CESSNA HAD CIRCLED ME AND WAS NOW 100 FT OFF MY R WINGTIP. I'M SURE HE WAS FUMING MAD AND WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE HIS FRUSTRATION WITH ME. I DIDN'T SEE THE PLT AS I WAS STUNNED TO SEE SUCH A LARGE ACFT SUDDENLY APPEAR ALONGSIDE OF ME; AND I WAS STILL SO THROWN (AND PUMPED WITH ADRENALINE) RECOUNTING THE DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT I'D PLACED MYSELF AND THE JUMPER(S) INTO. I REALIZED AT THIS POINT MY RADIO WAS TUNED TO ALBANY; NOT BRADLEY ATC. I CHANGED FREQS AND TALKED WITH BRADLEY ATC. THEY IMMEDIATELY SAID; 'ACFT X; WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH YOU FOR 15 MI.' I REPLIED 'I LOST COMS.' THEY ASKED IF I SAW THE JUMPER. I REPLIED 'AFFIRMATIVE; I SAW THE JUMPER.' SHORTLY AFTER THIS THEY PASSED ME OVER TO ZBW. FROM THIS POINT; IT BECAME A PRETTY ROUTINE LNDG AT PVD; BUT I WAS THOROUGHLY DISTR BY THE JUMP ZONE INCIDENT AND THE CESSNA 208B ALONGSIDE OF ME. AFTER PARKING AT FBO; I CALLED FSS TO REVIEW MY FLT PATH AND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY TFR'S ALONG MY COURSE. THE ANSWER WAS NO. I THEN DROVE TO FBO #2 AND SPOKE WITH A CFI. I EXPLAINED WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED. HE EXPLAINED LOST COMS AND LOST SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WAS MY FAULT AS PIC. HE ADVISED I SHOULD SPEND MORE TIME REVIEWING MY FLT PLANS AND BEING AWARE OF MY INTENDED AND ACTUAL FLT PATH -- WHICH I WILL. HOWEVER; BRADLEY ATC; KNOWING THEY COULDN'T VERBALLY CONTACT ME FOR 15 MI AND COULD SEE I WAS ON A STRAIGHT AND STEADY HDG (AT APPROX 120 KTS) AT APPROX 115 DEGS AT 5500 FT FOR QUITE A WHILE -- LEADING RIGHT INTO THE ACTIVE JUMP ZONE; DIDN'T NOTIFY THE CESSNA 208B JUMP PLANE. IN THIS SHARED 'SEE AND AVOID' AIRSPACE THE JUMP PLANE ALLOWED JUMPERS TO LEAP FROM HIS PLANE. WHY DIDN'T BRADLEY ATC ASK THE JUMP PLANE TO WAIT A MIN OR TWO UNTIL I WAS THROUGH THE AREA? WHY DIDN'T THE JUMP PLANE SEE ME? I EVEN CALLED A C206 JUMP PLANE PLT TO DISCUSS THIS EVENT. HE AGREED THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT IS A SHARED AIRSPACE. EVEN A BARE BONES PIPER J-3 CUB (WITH NO RADIOS AND NO XPONDER) IS PERMITTED TO PASS DIRECTLY THROUGH THE JUMP ZONE. IT'S NOT ADVISABLE BUT IT'S STILL FAA LEGAL. NO ONE WAS INJURED. HOWEVER; THIS WAS FAR TOO CLOSE FOR ME. I WILL SPEND MORE TIME REVIEWING MY FLT PATH AND ENSURING I'M TUNED INTO TO CORRECT FREQS. I AM A SAFE PLT.

CLBING THROUGH APPROX 2500 FT; APCH ADVISED US TO CLB TO 5000 FT AND ASKED OUR INTENTIONS. THE PIC ANSWERED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD UNTIL CLRED ONTO OUR NEXT FIX. AT THIS POINT; THE PIC RESET THE GARMIN ALT SETTING TO 5000 FT; AND THE AUTOPLT TO 6000 FT. I NOTICED THIS MIS-SETTING; BUT DID NOT REMARK ON IT AT THE TIME. WE WERE CLBING THROUGH 4000 FT; I WANTED TO SEE IF THE PIC WOULD CATCH HIS INADVERTENT MISTAKE. WE WERE CLBING IN THE HOLD AND GIVEN NEW INSTRUCTIONS: 'CONTINUE THE HOLD; FLY OUTBOUND ON THE 190 DEG RADIAL.' THE PIC ASKED ME IF WE WERE MEANT TO FLY BACK TO THE VOR FIRST OR TURN DIRECTLY TO INTERCEPT THE RADIAL. I REPLIED THAT WE MUST GO TO THE VOR FIRST. MY ATTN WAS DIVERTED BY HELPING THE PIC SET UP THE PFD AND KEEP AN EYE OUTSIDE FOR TFC. WE FLEW THROUGH THE ASSIGNED ALT TO 5600 FT. THE CTLR TOLD US: 'WHAT IS YOUR ALT? WHAT IS YOUR ALTIMETER SETTING? DSND IMMEDIATELY; TURN L TO A HDG 190 DEGS; THERE IS CONFLICTING TFC; AND YOU CAN BE EXPECTING A CALL FROM US!' WE COMPLIED IMMEDIATELY WITH A L TURN AND A DSCNT. THE CTLR'S TONE WAS ANXIOUS. THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF ANY RESPONSE ASIDE FROM 'ROGER.' ATC TOOK US SBOUND FOR A WHILE BEFORE TURNING US E TOWARD 'NEETS' INTXN AND RKD; OUR DEST. FACTORS: 1) HAVING A NON-INTEGRATED AUTOPLT ADDS AN EXTRA BURDEN TO THE PLT DURING A COUPLED INST APCHS. 2) CLEARER DISTINCTION WITHIN THE CREW ON SAFETY PLT/CHK PLT/INSTRUCTOR PLT ROLE. I SHOWED UP FOR THIS FLT EXPECTING TO BE A SAFETY PLT; THE PIC WISHES TO DO A CHK RIDE. I SHOULD HAVE ADVISED THE PIC OF THE AUTOPLT SETTING WHEN NOTICED. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF THE SAFETY OF THE FLT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION. 3) MY LACK OF RECENT TIME ON THE G1000 IN AN IFR ENVIRONMENT. 4) LACK OF MISSED APCH PLANNING. I HAD NOT STUDIED THE APCH PRIOR TO FLYING IT; AND WE DID NOT THOROUGHLY BRIEF THE MISSED APCH (SAFETY PLT/CHK PLT ISSUE). 5) ATC COULD HAVE ALERTED US EARLIER OF THE DEV.

THEREFORE; I ASKED FOR ANOTHER ROOM; WHICH TOOK ABOUT 45 MINS TO ARRANGE. UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY REPLACEMENT ROOM WAS NEAR AN ELEVATOR ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

THIS MEANS THAT THE TFC WAS ONLY 500 FT ABOVE US. I WAS PNF AND STATED 'WE SEE IT ON OUR TCAS; LOOKING FOR TFC.' AT THAT MOMENT THE TCAS STARTED BLINKING RED AND STATED 'MONITOR VERT SPD.' THE VSI TURNED RED AND DEPICTED THE TARGET. MY FO TOOK THE RED VSI INDICATION TO MEAN THAT SHE SHOULD CLB IN ORDER TO AVOID THE CONFLICT. WE NEVER RECEIVED A VERBAL CUE TO CLB OR DSND; NOR DID WE SEE ANY VERT SPD 'DOUGHNUT' ON THE SCREEN TO AIM TOWARDS.

MY FO AND I PULLED OUT OUR SYS MANUAL FOR THE CRJ AND LOOKED UP THE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE INDICATIONS OF THE TCAS SYS AND REVIEWED WHAT HAD JUST TRANSPIRED. WE DECIDED THAT WE HAD BOTH INCORRECTLY INTERPED THE RED 'ABOVE' TARGET ON THE VSI AND RESPONDED IMPROPERLY. WE FURTHER REVIEWED THE PROCS; AGREEING THAT A PERSON SHOULD FLY 'AWAY' FROM THE RED VSI INDICATION; IF INSTRUCTED VIA RA. HOWEVER; IN OUR CASE; WE SIMPLY SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED OUR CURRENT ASSIGNED ALT OF 7000 FT AND MONITORED; AS INSTRUCTED BY THE TCAS VOICE. I DID NOT TAKE THE CTLS; ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE; BECAUSE I HAD THE ACFT IN SIGHT. I KNEW WE WENT THROUGH OUR ASSIGNED ALT THOUGH AT THE MOMENT WE DID IT I WASN'T SURE THAT WE WERE IN FACT RESPONDING IMPROPERLY. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED; I IMMEDIATELY INFORMED ATC.

This large white light blocked out the helicopter's other lights and made it appear as another bright white light in the city of Lebanon. At the prior described location; I noticed that we were on a near-head-on collision course; and maneuvered the aircraft with about 30 degrees of bank and about 1/2 mile to the east (right turn) of centerline to avoid the traffic. Upon landing; I had 2 of the 9 passengers ask what was up with the helicopter flying so close to us and few others exclaim that they were wondering why we suddenly banked sharply. I estimate the distance between aircraft was 350-500 FT. After landing; I asked ATC if the helicopters used the call sign 'Life Guard' or were always considered as a 'Life Guard' flight. The reply is that they are only considered as 'Life Guard' when they use those words; which they were not at this time. As a result; I believe they were in violation of the right-of-way rules (FAR 91.113) and caused a commercial flight to break off of visual approach guidance and to deviate toward rising terrain. I was in an aircraft with a Garmin GNS 430 and happened to have it selected to the terrain page with 120 Arc. I saw a lot of yellow. I reestablished on final and landed without any further incident.",,,,"A commercial light twin experienced an NMAC with an EMS helicopter while on a night visual approach to LEB.",

We were cleared for visual approach to Runway 24 MVY. Checked in with MVY Tower and cleared for left downwind to Runway 24. I descended to pattern altitude (1500msl) and entered the left downwind. Tower instructed us to extend our downwind for landing traffic/departure and told us the tower would call our base turn. As we continued on the downwind I observed an aircraft slightly higher than our altitude and between us and the extended centerline of MVY Runway 24 just past the shoreline (about 4 to 5 miles from MVY). The aircraft was flying erratically and there was no TCAS target. A white biplane was observed spinning down to our altitude and was near to abeam of our position when tower called our base turn. By that time the biplane was beginning a loop. I refused the turn from tower and continued downwind until I was sure to be clear of the aerobatic traffic. We then turned base to final with no incident. When I advised tower of the incident the reply was (he; the biplane is not in my airspace).Tower should not extend traffic into airspace they are not going to be responsible for. Aerobatic activities should be NOTAM'ed. I asked a few questions after my Passenger told me several biplanes operated commercially in the area. I was told there are two biplanes operating out of a field near MVY; one of which matched the aircraft I observed. The biplane operators should not operate near active runway approach paths. If commercial aerobatic operations are going on; how about designating a box for aerobatic operations like found anywhere else there are regular aerobatic ops like St. Augustine; FL. If the aircraft had his transponder on we might have had more warning of his proximity and I am sure if his transponder was on we would have got an RA. That might be why his transponder was off. I don't know if it is common practice to kill your squawk while doing aerobatics but I would recommend leaving it on. Tower did not seem to be concerned; MVY FBO personnel were familiar with the aerobatic operations.",,,,"LR60 Captain on extended left downwind at MVY reports conflict with aircraft doing aerobatics the Tower reported the traffic was not in MVY airspace.",

Initially; we transited the Class B south of the airspace. Then transited back from the south to the north for some more work; just outside to the Bravo on the north side. I told the Tower; although outside of the airspace we would continue to monitor with them. After completing that work; the customer asked us to video tape some activity at the state house; which borders the Boston Common. I called the Tower; requested clearance back into the Bravo for that destination. I was then cleared to do so. I then requested to operate at 1;500 FT. The normal altitude is 1;000. I was also cleared for this. Approximately 2 miles west of our destination; I called the Tower and requested to hold between the Boston Common and the 8 DME to the west for noise abatement; while we were waiting for the event to start. I was cleared for that request. Upon reaching the Boston Common; I started to make a 180 degree turn back to the west and head for the 8 DME. The controller then pointed out traffic departing Logan. While I was looking for the traffic the Controller questioned where I was working; which was well inside the boundaries that I had requested and was cleared for. He said that I could not be off the departure end of the runway at that altitude and must descend to 800 FT. After clearing beneath me; I started a descent to 800 FT. I then questioned the controller about the altitude. I thought I may have missed something in the earlier clearance. But I am 99% sure that I did not. We work regularly at the altitude of 1;500 over the Boston Common with 27 and 33 departures. The only thing that I can think of is that the controller was not familiar with the site picture from the Tower. And again the Controller was working two frequencies at the same time. Looking back; as busy as he was; I am not sure he was completely aware of what he was clearing me for. To help this situation; I feel that the Controller should have taken a minute to clarify in his own mind what I was going to do and if not; question it before we got there. Also; when there is the slightest doubt that the controller is not understanding what he is clearing me for; I will reconfirm the clearance with them; no matter how often and normal a particular request is.",,,,"Helicopter pilot requests clearance into BOS Class B airspace over the downtown area at 1;500 FT which is granted by the Tower.

Boston Center informed us that we would get cleared higher when past an Airbus that was east of us at 16;000' and converging.  We both saw the Airbus on what appeared to be a parallel ground track.  We reported the Airbus in sight and Boston cleared us to climb to 17;000' and maintain visual separation. As we continued to climb; I realized that the Airbus was stationary in the side window and getting closer.  About the time I suggested to my First Officer that we level off below his altitude; we got a TCAS RA aural warning directing us to monitor vertical speed and visual display showing us to maintain level flight or descend.  We stopped climbing and leveled off at 15;200'. We reported to Boston that we had leveled off; that we had been responding to an RA; and that our intention was to maintain our altitude until we had passed behind the other aircraft. We passed a couple of hundred yards behind and about 800 feet below the Airbus soon afterwards.  Once clear on the left side of the Airbus; with a diverging vector; we continued our climb to 17;000'. The Boston Center Controller asked us how close the RA had been and I answered '800 ft below.'  He said 'no problem' and shortly cleared us for an early turn on course. In light of the difficulty of estimating range visually to another aircraft; we should have monitored the map display to assess lateral separation and lateral closure. That would have indicated to us that we should have shallowed out our climb to let the other aircraft pass across our nose and to increase lateral separation before climbing through within 1000 feet of its altitude.",,"Boston Center called out Airbus traffic at 10 o'clock level at 16;000'.

I instructed the Tower to assign the departing small jet a heading of 320 because I was not sure what the on-course heading would be and I wanted to prevent a confliction with the aircraft inbound on the ILS.  (This instruction was predicated on my erroneous belief that the aircraft would depart Runway 5.)

I requested Runway 24 and we were granted that request.  The Controller gave us an eastbound vector and descended us to 5000'. (May have been 6000' can't recall.)  We were being vectored in from the northwest on a right base to join the ILS to 24.  At approximately 15-20 miles northwest of Runway 24 while level at our assigned altitude; I began to hear a roaring noise.  My initial thought was that there was another aircraft in our near vicinity.  I scanned the TCAS readout and saw no Traffic Advisories. I scoped down to a smaller range and still saw nothing. I scanned outside but did not see any traffic.  We were in and out of the clouds (broken clouds; 2000-3000 foot thick) and while visibility was good between the clouds; I was unable to pick up the traffic visually.  The Captain and I commented something to the effect that there is another airplane and he's got to be right on top of us. Just then I noticed the first illumination of a TA on our TCAS.  It was a white +003 directly on top of the aircraft symbol.  The TCAS never gave us any RAs. I queried the Approach Controller saying; 'Do you have traffic on top of us?' The Controller did not seem very concerned and said that there were a pair of F-15s departing Barnes (which I believe we were directly south of at the time).  He also said that we were in a heavy military operations area and left it at that. He did not offer any more information about the separation we had with the departing fighters.  The roar of the passing F-15s lasted somewhere between five and seven seconds.The remainder of the flight was uneventful. My concern is that we were not given adequate separation from the departing F-15s. I suppose that it is possible to hear passing aircraft while in flight and still have adequate separation; but I highly doubt that is the case here.  The sound from the fighters was at least as loud if not louder than when you are holding short of 12R in STL and an F-15 is launching right in front of you.  And the noise lasted for a sustained seven seconds or so. I am curious to know what kind of separation we were given.  I feel that it is highly likely that an ATC error or F-15 Pilot error may have reduced our separation.  Because of the IMC conditions and insufficient TCAS Advisories; I believe that we were completely at the mercy of ATC in this situation.  I do not think there is anything we could have done to increase the separation between us and the departing F-15s. I think that ATC could have issued Traffic Advisories and may have needed to provide greater separation.",,"While on an easterly vector from Bradley Approach at 5000 ft about 15 NM NE of BDL; my First Officer and I heard a jet engine noise close by our aircraft.

A hand off was initiated and accepted by Sector 32.  Air Carrier X was issued a frequency change.  Military Y was flying Northeast bound from WRI to HTO climbing to FL210.  Military Y's route of flight after HTO was to the GFL107018 fix then ENE272045 fix.  Initially looking at the flight paths and speeds of these aircraft it did not look like they would come in close proximity.  Military Y asked for a clearance direct to the ENE272045 fix which would have kept him on a northeastern course. First; I attempted to use the URET to preview the route.  URET did not make previewing the route to that fix available.  Instead; I used the radar route command to check for conflicts prior to the Radar Controller issuing the clearance.  In doing this; the GFL107018 fix was dropped from the flight plan.  The route cleared.  Just before the clearance was issued; Military Y changed his request to go direct to the GFL107018 fix which would turn him to the northwest.  I clicked on Military Y's route on the URET screen so that I could bring back his previous route since the GFL107018 fix was no longer part of his route.  The URET screen gave me an error message saying the route menu list is not available.  The radar controller had to ask Military Y what the radial fix was because we no longer had it listed in his flight plan and the route window would not even come up on URET.  I typed in the fix as the pilot read it to us using the radar route command and then I looked at the flight plan on the URET screen to tie the GFL107018 fix back into the rest of his route of flight.  As I was fixing the route on the flight plan; Military Y was issued the clearance to fly direct to the GFL107018 fix.  When this clearance was issued the two radar controllers noticed the conflict between Military Y and Air Carrier X because they were now converging and Air Carrier X was slowly descending and still above Military Y.  Both controllers issued instructions to each aircraft in order to maintain separation.  Air Carrier X was told to maintain FL220.  Military Y was issued a heading.  Both aircraft were issued traffic advisories.  My radar controller put up a J-ring around Military Y.  Military Y was level at FL210 and accelerating.  Air Carrier X was descending out of FL220 and slowing down while in his descent.  The aircraft were about 7 miles apart.  It appeared on the scope that the aircraft were about 5-6 miles apart when the data blocks showed Air Carrier X at FL216; climbing; and Military Y at FL210.  Air Carrier X gave a report level at FL220 just as the target was on the line of the Military Y J-ring.  Standard separation was regained and Military Y was reissued his clearance direct to the GFL107018 fix.  The Front Line Manager was in the isle while this event was occurring.  We did not believe that separation was lost but that it was close. We should have been more vigilant is noticing the changing speeds of the aircraft involved as well as the descent rate of Air Carrier X.  We were all distracted by trying to work with URET to preview the route request.  URET did not make previewing direct to either fix available therefore we had to use the radar commands to get the display.  We were further distracted when the pilot changed his route request and the previously issued route could not be displayed by URET.  There should have been one controller focusing on the route in the flight plan and another controller watching the scope for possible conflicts.",,"My Radar Associate was having trouble reentering the GFL radials into the system; and I needed to ask Military Y one or two more times the exact radials. This distracted both me; my Instructor; and my Radar Associate. Once the routing problem was solved I cleared Military Y to the GFL radials and noticed the conflict alert was going off between Air Carrier X and Military Y. Military Y had increased speed significantly and Air Carrier X had decreased. I told the Radar Controller at Sector 32 to stop Air Carrier X at FL220 but at that point he was already going through that altitude and had to climb approximately 400 feet to be level at FL220. Also; I turned Military Y to a 050 heading to parallel Air Carrier X; but then realized that because they were in a turn to the GFL radials it wasn't going to work; so I told them to expedite a turn to heading 080. Air Carrier X leveled off at FL 220 5 miles from Military Y at Fl 210.Keep a close eye on speeds; aircraft speed up when they level off and slow down when they begin a descent.

Nearing PWL we got a TA on our TCAS for VFR traffic 400 FT below us and about 3 miles; just as the aircraft was turning to what I believed to be V-44 towards LOVES Intersection.  This TCAS alert distracted us for verifying the next waypoint.  Shortly afterwards; ATC gave us a left turn to a heading of 150 degrees; and then questioned why we had turned to the southwest instead of the southeast.  Looking at our FMS; it was now headed for a fix that was not on V-44 but may have been from the previous STAR; the IGN8.The numerous ATC changes for routing; headings; altitudes; and speeds; coupled with the congestion on the radio added to the work load for re-programming the FMS'; which; evidently; caused a waypoint insertion error.  A better solution for ATC would have been to merely re-clear us via the PWL2 arrival which is almost identical to the route they gave us.  You might say ATC set us up for failure.  Thankfully; I don't believe there was ever a conflict with any other IFR traffic.",,,,"An F-900 Flight Crew misprogrammed a routing change from ATC and a track deviation; quickly resolved by ATC; ensued.",

I asked the pilot to confirm he was requesting the GPS-B; to which he replied affirmative. After what seemed to be a long time the low wing fixed gear aircraft advised that he had found PPICE. I told the low wing fixed gear aircraft to proceed direct to PPICE; this should have put the aircraft on an estimated 040 heading.

I then descended the air carrier and climbed single engine. For myself; next time I will climb the second CQX traffic to a higher available altitude; if available. Having many regional airports in our airspace we seem to be seeing more pilot deviations due to pilots not being completely in control of their aircraft due to unfamiliarity with the use of auto-pilot/flight management systems in small aircraft.

HYA advised 'no you can't turn him I have a jet departing shortly going over SEY' which the tower Controller must have thought to be a 240 heading. For some reason the Tower Controller ignored the fact that the first fix was COSSY which is approximately a 270 heading. Normally departures are assigned a heading that will enable the Radar Controller to expedite the individual departure on course. I advised the Tower Controller he may want to call before over to the Departure Controller before getting 'too creative' with vectors. Controller seemed to take offense to this and made some snide comment about using RADAR.  This is not the first time we have had a problem with HYA FCT using headings for departures that create problems of various degrees for pilots and controllers. In a recent event HYA FCT turned both IFR and VFR departures toward a TFR over FMH. Only the quick reaction of the Departure Controller kept the aircraft away from the TFR.

Besides putting band aid fixes to the known safety issues; these problems still arise and loss of separation can very easily be had. I took the hand off on Air Carrier X (E145) and the aircraft was changed to my frequency below 10;000 FT MSL and prior to BONNZ intersection. In trail was Air Carrier Y (A319) which was also switched to my frequency prior to 10;000 FT MSL and prior to BONNZ. The much better performing Air Carrier Y was out-climbing Air Carrier X with about 6.5 miles. Worried about a potential overtake; I asked Air Carrier Y his speed. Being short of BONNZ; but about to level at 14;000 FT; the pilot responded 250 KTS. Further questioning led to find out that this was not assigned by Boston Departure but merely flying the SID as assigned. If I had never questioned the situation; I am very sure that these two aircraft would have been in an overtake situation would have ensued and separation would have been lost. There was no attempt by the Boston Departure Controller to provide the '5 miles constant or increasing' as required by the common LOA. Very shortly thereafter two more successive departures left Boston on the PATTS1 SID to enter my airspace. Just as stated above; both aircraft were on my frequency climbing to 14;000 FT MSL and prior to BONNZ. The first aircraft; Air Carrier Z (E190); asked me 5 miles prior to BONNZ when he was expected to disregard the 250 KTS speed restriction. I questioned his statement to find out that the Boston Departure Controller had issued maximum speed as soon as possible. The pilot was confused; I was confused; and in no way did this provide for positive separation with the trailing aircraft.

We did not hear this instruction to the other traffic. We were on the descent to Runway 29 and at about two miles (900 FT); the other aircraft appeared at 12 o'clock and maybe 200 FT above; wings level. Aircraft was not seen before it was very close. Bottom of aircraft was dirty white and clouds were gray. Aircraft passed overhead before I could take evasive action. I immediately notified the Tower that traffic had just passed directly over us. After landing; on Ground Control; I advised the Tower I would call them on the land line. Called Tower and spoke to manager. A while later; I received a call from the aircraft owner; he said the pilot was still flying.Almost an hour later; I received a call from the pilot. We talked about the incident. The pilot is not from this area and did not seem familiar with the area. His location on the downwind put him over the waters of Long Island Sound so he had very little ground reference for his 360 turn back on to the down wind. I asked him about the wind and he stated 340 at 6. We discussed the wind at pattern altitude and I suggested it might be much stronger and more from the North (local knowledge). He agreed the wind and lack of ground references over the water could have allowed him to drift down wind during his 360 turn on downwind. The lack of RADAR at this airport was a direct factor in this NMAC! The FAA commitment to install RADAR in 1994 has still not been fulfilled! I have been a pilot for over 50 years.  This is my fourth NMAC at this airport! Three of the four NMAC's have occurred since 1994; when the FAA said they would install RADAR. All three would have been prevented with RADAR in the Tower!

During the RA maneuver the Captain visually acquired contact with the target aircraft (high-wing Cessna single engine) and estimated our separation as 100 FT vertical and 0 FT lateral. The Captain then relayed to BOS Approach that we had just responded to an RA. The Controller ignored the transmission. The Controller seemed extremely busy at the time. There would certainly have been a collision had we not responded immediately to the RA.

I RADAR identified the aircraft then instructed them to turn left direct BRRRO Intersection and climb and maintain 5;000. I can not recall what the pilot read back but I recognized the aircraft turning south to the RHODE Intersection. The conflict occurred when another aircraft was in the downwind to Runway 4R at 5;000. The course to the RHODE Intersection was underlying the arrival downwind. I instructed Aircraft X to turn left to 180 and then further left to 120 with out delay. Aircraft X was on a diverging heading by the time that vertical separation was lost with the aircraft on the down wind. The confusion over the issuance and pilot acknowledgment of the RNAV departure procedures from the BOS airport will eventually evolve into a near miss situation. The strip marking and the camera used to broadcast the strip to the TRACON is either unintelligible (strip marking) or so poorly lit the entire strip is unrecognizable. Earlier in the evening another aircraft departed Runway 15R with the RNAV in the PDR portion of the strip and the pilot denied being issued the departure procedure. Prior to this event there have been a lot of issues with ZBW taking hand off's. When the RNAV departures started there was an OM at Boston Center (ZBW ) who wrote an memorandum which instructed the controllers there not to take hand off's or climb aircraft from the TRACON until a specific intersection. This was to be briefed as a good operating procedure. The RNAV SID's are designed to get aircraft higher quicker. By not taking the hand off; the aircraft are level and lower on the departure. This creates an issue for the TRACON controller by questioning if a hand off has been made but also a compression issue in most situations because of aircraft weight and performance. There is no written procedure to pass speed information so one must call the sector. There have been a few occasions when they do not answer and one is forced to switch the aircraft with out proper land line coordination. This will cause issues this summer when volume increases. The RNAV SID's also create one westbound route from Boston where we had two before. There have been instances where controllers have taken aircraft off the departure route in order to expedite the flow of traffic; not for immediate traffic situations. These instances were not premeditated or reckless behavior from the controller. In these instances TRACON management team has briefed the controller that type of flow will not be permitted and to leave the aircraft on the route as much as possible. This has led to more step climbing and speed restrictions which creates more conflicts with arriving traffic; not even considering the negative impact to the customers. This also has another impact. Aircraft not on a RNAV (Logan SID) do not have speed restrictions built on the departure for West bound flight off Runway 22. On numerous instances; there have been unforeseen overtakes during the west bound turns; which is also during the hand off to the Center. This has made for instances where the TRACON had standard separation but the Center did not. Recommendation; change intersection names so there is no confusion. Install URET to replace hand written strips and camera. Develop a ground procedure that insures all aircraft have the proper departure procedure prior to takeoff.",,,,"A90 Controller gave a detailed account of a alleged unsafe condition regrading the new RNAV departure procedures from BOS; suggesting a number of enhanced operational procedures that should reduce errors.",

A C560 was handed off from N90 at 5;000 FT landing GON; as appropriate to the LOA. The C172 had previously been receiving RADAR advisories from me enroute to an airport within N90's airspace. A RADAR hand off was accomplished on the C172 and the aircraft was in communication with N90 at the time of the incident. Upon entering my airspace; I issued the C560 a 10 degree left turn and a decent to 3;000 FT and informed the aircraft to expect the Visual Approach. As I finished issuing those instructions; and scanned ahead of the C560; I observed that the C172 I had already switched to N90 could possibly be a factor given those instructions. I immediately issued traffic to the C560 and instructed the aircraft to expedite to 4;000 FT. The aircraft acknowledged the traffic and expedite instructions. A moment later; it was clear the expedited descent was not enough and I instructed the C560 to turn a further 20 degrees left to avoid the traffic. At that time; the C172's altitude read out was still level at 4;500 FT and the C560's altitude read out was 4;700 FT. I then observed the altitude read out for the C560 begin to climb and the pilot responded to my instruction to turn with the information that they were responding to a TCAS RA and climbing. I acknowledged the instruction and waited until the aircraft were well clear before issuing another descent to the C560. The Supervisor was in the TRACON at the time of the incident and upon receiving notification from the C560 of the TCAS RA; I immediately informed him and he acknowledged the event. The C560 subsequently received a Visual Approach to GON and landed without further incident. I am unaware of any communication between the C172 and N90 with regard to the incident. This event was the result of a poor scan. The most appropriate action would have been to scan ahead of the control instruction; which would likely have resulted in simply leaving the C560 at 5;000 FT until passing the C172. The descent was not absolutely necessary given that GON was landing on Runway 23 at the time and the aircraft had plenty of time to descend after it had passed the traffic. Additionally; a turn to the right (particularly had it been 20 or 30 degrees instead of 10) as opposed to the left would have likely caused the C560 to pass behind the traffic even with the descent.",,,,"PVD Controller described a TCAS RA event when altitude adjustments and vector headings were simply not given in sufficient time to secure separation.",

I departed and; at roughly 1;100 MSL; I initiated my left turn to 250. BED Tower then gave me an immediate hand-off to Boston Approach. As I was tuning the radio to 124.4 I lowered the nose to check for traffic. I then saw a [high wing light aircraft] zip by at roughly 500 FT horizontal distance and roughly 150 to 200 FT vertical distance. The [other aircraft] didn't appear to have taken any evasive action. I did not either; as we were on nearly orthogonal courses. Neither Bedford Tower before the hand off nor Boston Approach after the hand off called any specific traffic. On my departure I never had the downwind traffic BED Tower called out in sight. I also never told them I had the traffic. They passed the traffic alert with my departure clearance while I was still on the ground holding short of Runway 29. Despite being a flight instructor; and having reminded trainees on many occasions that departing an IFR flight plan doesn't relieve the pilot of full traffic awareness when in VMC; I allowed my focus on IFR procedures during a VMC departure from an unfamiliar airport to interfere with and reduce the amount of time I spent looking out of the windows for traffic. I was focused on my vectors to the BOSOX Intersection; the hand off to Boston Approach and not enough on looking for traffic. I am glad that I lowered the nose and took a look; but overall my eyes were inside too much. Also; as I have told many trainees; the pilot workload is higher for an IFR departure in VMC because you have to do all the IFR cockpit tasks; but also all the VFR traffic avoidance tasks. I am lucky that we missed each other.

When I passed abeam of 8B1; I began verifying frequencies on my charts and tuning radios in preparation for contacting Boston Approach. I was required to contact Boston Approach because our route of flight would take us through the edge of Manchester Class C airspace prior to entering Nashua Class D. While I was performing this task; a passenger remarked that there was a 'big airplane to our right.' I looked up and saw a single-engine retractable-gear converging at my 1 o'clock and about a half mile; northeast bound; at or slightly above my altitude. I immediately pitched down and turned to the right so as to pass below and behind the converging traffic. The other airplane made no apparent change in altitude indicated 3;100 FT; so our vertical separation was about 400 FT and I estimated our horizontal separation was about the same. Both aircraft were operating at the appropriate altitude for the direction of flight. The aircraft to my right had the right of way and thanks to my observant passenger I was able to see and yield to that aircraft. Upon reflection however; there are still lessons to be learned:1. A traffic alert system; whether an on-board electronic system; ATC flight following; or an observant passenger; contributes to the see and avoid concept and greatly increases safety.2. Complex cockpit tasks; such as finding and tuning multiple radio frequencies should be divided into smaller tasks so that the pilot can avoid longer periods of 'head-down' time and thereby scan for traffic more frequently; and3. Although pilots receive training in scanning for traffic and practice maneuvers that require immediate pilot input; such as go-arounds; stall recover; and recovery from critical attitudes; at no time can I remember receiving training in traffic avoidance maneuvers at cruise speeds. Such training might be beneficial. Of course; it would always be better to practice items 1 & 2 and resolve conflicts sooner.",,,,"A PA28 passenger detected converging traffic at 3;500 FT near 8B1 as the pilot was looking at charts for frequencies and so the pilot took evasive action to avoid the other aircraft by 400 FT.",

Runway heading off of Runway 6 was agreed upon by the Developmental and the Tower; I then questioned the Tower if we could have control of the aircraft upon departure. The request was approved by the Tower. After the PA28 was RADAR identified; the Developmental turned the aircraft to a heading 310; to maneuver the aircraft for a left downwind for the ILS 6 final approach course. In the meantime; the Tower released a King Air off of Runway 6 on a heading of 010 climbing to 2;000 FT; putting the King Air and the PA28 on converging courses with the same altitude assigned. When the King Air checked in on the assigned heading of 010; I immediately took over the frequency to stop the climb of the King Air at 1;500 FT (the MVA for that area) and turned the aircraft right to a heading of 090; behind the PA28. I then called traffic to the King Air; the pilot reported the traffic in sight; and the pilot was then instructed to maintain visual separation. After the aircraft passed I climbed the King Air to 4;000 FT and then turned the aircraft on course. ACK and HYA Towers both use the ARTS rundown departure list. HYA Tower puts the assigned heading of the departing aircraft in the run down list when the aircraft is rolling. ACK Tower only puts the departure runway in the list when the aircraft is rolling; the assigned heading is unknown to the Approach Controller prior to aircraft checking in with Departure. Since the technology already exists; I recommend that ACK Tower be required to put the assigned heading in the run down list as well. If an Approach Controller notices that the heading assigned to the aircraft will put the departure in conflict with traffic; the Approach Controller can be proactive and coordinate a different heading with Tower early enough that separation errors and unsafe situations never develop. This has been brought up to ACK Tower in the past; however ACK Tower resisted the change. Doing this would not alleviate responsibility on either the Tower or Approach Controller; but would be added tool of situational awareness for the Approach Controller.",,,,"K90 Controller described a near loss of separation event involving missed coordination with an ACK Tower.

So we asked the Controller about the progress of the jump operations. ATC then gave us a turn to 060. After completing the turn; and less than a minute later; ATC came back and said jump operations were several minutes earlier and probably concluded. Then another Controller came on the frequency and said cleared direct to BONDI (one of the fixes on the approach). So we turned back to 090; heading to BONDI.

Air Carrier X was in level flight just inside the northeast corner of my sector headed northwest bound to MSP at FL380. Sector 08 was busy working reroutes to PHL; DCA; IAD and BWI. I took two point outs on aircraft at FL380 and FL360; I cannot remember the call signs and I think both aircraft were overseas arrivals to PHL. RA08 called me with the point outs and I referenced traffic and said; 'This guy should be flashing at you anyway.' RA08 said something like; 'we'll be under him' and Air Carrier X's hand off to 08 was taken. I was focusing on aircraft in the southwest part of my sector. I did not notice that 08's aircraft at FL380 had slowly begun to descend until there was approximately 8 miles between my Air Carrier X and Sector 08's. I yelled across the isle asking 08 if that aircraft was hustling down. I turned my aircraft 30R thinking it would be enough especially with an expeditious decent. I don't think it worked. Sectors 08 and 09 were split off that morning after the stand up. On break; before this event; I asked the CIC during the stand up why 08 and 09 were split off so early. There was no volume then to justify the split. The CIC told me that the FLM came back after stand up and said he was told to split 08 and 09; I think it was in preparation for reroutes and bad weather. Eight and nine remained split all morning. I think one element to this event was the unusual complexity that was introduce because of the reroutes and our SOP with those aircraft along with the added complexity of working more constraining airspace. Sectors 08 and 09 were never recombined that morning because the reroutes caused for spurts of volume according to the Traffic Situation Display (TSD). In the past 08 and 09 have been combined; the TSD showed a 'red' sector; and the OM called and ordered it split off. The spurts shown on the TSD were not really spurts but shared aircraft between 08 and 09; so if the sectors were combined; as is the usual practice; the TSD would show a smaller number than simply adding the two numbers. A good time for 08 and 09 to be split is when there is a high amount of volume and low complexity. However; when there is a high amount of complexity and anything higher than moderate volume in 08 and 09; it is a detriment to have it split off because the airspace becomes constrictive. The decision to split these sectors should rest on the shoulders of the FLM and the controllers working the sector. I also think it should be considered to redraw 08 and 09 with the purpose to ease complexity not volume.",,,,"ZBW Controller indicated a probable loss of separation event noting facility sector combination protocols were contributory to this event; adding combination decisions should be made at the sector level.",

The weather was approximately OVC020 at ACK; and all over the Cape Cod area. The normal air-to-air frequencies are used as Clearance Delivery frequencies; as well as air-to-air frequencies when Cape Approach and the airport Towers are closed. We had airplanes calling on the frequency requesting departure clearances every couple of minutes; and they were starting to get testy that we were making them wait; as we have a one-in-one-out rule. A C402 checked in; at first we thought he was on the ground looking for a clearance; and then we realized he was in the air; but thought he was looking for an IFR clearance; and then eventually he made it clear he wanted VFR advisories to ACK; but he was already in the descent to the airport. The RADAR Controller gave him a beacon code and RADAR identified him; but did not tell him about the other aircraft that was inbound on the ILS; approximately 2-3 miles away; also descending into ACK. I prodded the RADAR Controller a couple of times; and he finally called the traffic to one of the aircraft; I can't remember which; but not to the other; and was fairly vague about what the plane was doing. He is normally very thorough; so I can only guess that it was the complexity of the traffic situation with all the departures trying to get clearances and giving others holding instructions that diverted his attention from calling the traffic alert. I was lax in not being forceful enough about his making sure they were both aware of the other traffic. After the data blocks separated; the IFR called up to cancel his flight plan; and asked if we were talking to a VFR airplane in the vicinity. The RADAR Controller responded in the affirmative; and the pilot said; 'He almost hit us;' and that the other airplane was flying around in the clouds. The RADAR Controller apologized and continued working the rest of the airplanes without incident. He tried to reach the VFR aircraft; but was unsuccessful. When Cape Approach called to open; I told them there was a VFR; and the call sign that we never got a hold of; and were not sure if he landed; and the Approach Controller said he would inform the Tower when they opened. The situation was made complex due to the sheer number of aircraft looking for departure/approach clearances and not understanding why they were being told they had to wait. If there was a separate Clearance Delivery frequency from the normal air-to-air frequency; I could have been talking to the planes on the ground while the RADAR Controller was working the planes in the air.

I had walked over to the LC side of the Tower and was monitoring LC operation when she had issued an aircraft a heading of 010 degrees and switched them to Departure Control. LC then solicited a land and hold short operation (LAHSO) to an aircraft 3 miles from the airport landing Runway 1 and the aircraft accepted the solicitation. LC then put a Cessna with a requested on course heading of 165 degrees in position on Runway 33 and advised the aircraft of their participation in LAHSO; the aircraft acknowledged. The LC then cleared the Cessna for takeoff and promptly put Air Carrier X in position on Runway 33 while advising them that an aircraft was landing Runway 1 and would hold short of Runway 33; Air Carrier X acknowledged. As the aircraft landing Runway 1 rolled out and was slowing to taxi speed the LC issued a heading of 350 degrees to the Cessna and switched them to Departure. The LC cleared Air Carrier X for take off runway heading. Shortly after I noticed Air Carrier X rotate and then level off; flying at approximately 100 feet above Runway 33; I pointed out the abnormality to LC. It was very quickly known why Air Carrier X was maneuvering in such a manor and we observed the Cessna flying directly in Air Carrier X's path approximately 500 feet above. The Departure Controller called the LC and asked what the Cessna was doing while the GC was simultaneously requesting to cross Runway 1 at taxiway Charlie with two aircraft. The LC ignored the GC and stated to the Departure Controller 'he's on a 350' referring to the Cessna but the Departure Controller did not acknowledge. Air Carrier X had flown the entire length of Runway 33 and then made a climbing left turn on their own. Then the Departure Controller called LC and instructed them to issue a 270 heading to Air Carrier X; LC acknowledged and issued the instruction. The LC then switched Air Carrier X to Departure. Air Carrier X acknowledged the instruction and informed LC that they had to make 'alternative maneuvers to avoid that traffic'. I then relieved the LC immediately. Our SOP states that LC is authorized to issue one of 3 headings to all VFR or IFR departures. For a Runway 15/19 operation local is authorized to issue headings 150; 170; and 190. For a Runway 33/1 operation Local Control is authorized to issue headings 330; 350; 010. The BTV SOP specifically states that local shall assign one of three appropriate headings 'predicated' on the departure's first fix. 6 lines later it states that if the Local Controller is unable to issue the appropriate heading to expedite traffic the heading to be assigned shall not conflict with the preceding departure. THIS IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION. Is the heading issued by Local Control determined by the departure first fix outside of the Burlington airspace; or is it for the efficient flow of traffic? Furthermore; the Local Controller is in a much more advantageous position to determine whether a VFR aircraft can resume their own navigation on course or not. Due to equipment limitations and update speeds the RADAR Controller is always about 4 to 5 seconds behind; the Local Controller is not. The situation that occurred between Air Carrier X and the Cessna could have been easily avoided if our SOP had well defined procedures and responsibilities for Local Control which it does not. If Local Control had the responsibility of putting VFR aircraft on course towards their destination then the Departure Controller would not need to even consider or wonder what heading the departure was issued; what direction they can turn them if required; and if they will conflict with any other departures. I recommend that to accomplish the mentioned vision the Local Controller would require delegated airspace which we do not. The Local Controller would also be responsible for all IFR or VFR separation within their airspace. The Local Controller would also be responsible for putting VFR aircraft on course and if they are unable to they would need to advise the Departure Controller.",,,,"BTV Controller described a confused departure event resulting in a conflict noting Tower procedures covering heading assignments are in need of revision",

The First Officer and I discussed the threat. We determined that our closest point of approach to 2B1 would be 5-6 NM west of the field. With northeast winds that would be more than sufficient clearance. Nevertheless; we planned to alter course even more to the west to avoid the area by a wider margin.Eight miles south of the field approximately over PEAKE Intersection; we saw the plane; in a climb; at our altitude. He passed off our left by about 250 FT laterally at the same altitude. After we were passed the C182 popped up on our traffic display behind us. That was his first electronic appearance to either us or Cape Approach. Although we had a traffic display; we were not relying on it. As a Garmin TIS; it piggybacks off Cape Approach's radar; and their radar had been unreliable over Nantucket Sound. That may not have been the problem; though. Other targets appeared. After landing I spoke with the Assistant Airport Manager. I told him how surprised I was to see the plane so far south and downwind of the airport. He explained that first; the plane's transponder had been intermittent last week. It had been fixed. Secondly; the reason why the jump plane was flying such a wide pattern was due to vociferous noise complaints from airport neighbors. The jump plane has been flying a couple of different wide teardrop patterns over the mid-Cape area to spread the noise. Without prior knowledge of his noise abatement strategy; our ability to avoid the jump plane was hampered.Our pilots should be advised of the jump plane's non-standard climbout patterns. Avoiding 2B1 by even 8 miles may not be enough. A direct line overhead Coast Guard Air Station (FMH) or Hyannis (HYA) may be required. Also; I would hope that the mechanical contributing factors could be addressed. We don't know if it was Cape Approach's radar outage or the jump plane's intermittent transponder that hampered Cape's ability to issue traffic advisories. Ultimately; we must of course understand that ATC's prime directive is the separation of IFR traffic. The responsibility to see and avoid VFR traffic rests with all of us.",,,,"A C182 jump aircraft near 2B1 was not detected on a small transport aircraft TIS and they had a near miss as the C-182 climbed over PEAKE Intersection.",

C208 was climbing to 13;500 FT for skydive activity in the vicinity of CCC. I was working the RADAR position at Sector 32. I gave the B757 direct to ROBER which is a left turn away from CCC in an attempt to keep these two flights away from each other. C208 was up and down all morning and his climb out had been relatively close to CCC. I made several traffic calls to both aircraft. C208 reported he was 2 minutes from jumpers away and wanted to change frequency to Approach. I told C208 to report the B757 in sight before I would release him from the frequency. C208 reported the traffic in sight. I noted C208 was still on a southbound heading and flying right into the path that the B757 was heading towards ROBER. I asked C208 where he was going and on what heading. C208 said he was in a left hand turn back to CCC and was heading 360. This left hand turn was unexpected and in my mind a poor decision made by the pilot. He was aware due to my several traffic calls that the conflicting flight was to his east heading southwest bound. A right hand turn would have been appropriate. The left turn put the two aircraft nose to nose at almost the same altitude because C208 was climbing and the B757 was descending. I reported to the B757 what C208 was doing and the pilot for the B757 said they were climbing in response to a resolution advisory. The B757 reported the conflict was over and was now descending to 12;000 FT as previously cleared to. We have had many issues with the skydive activity over CCC. The pilots for this company seem more concerned with changing to Approach frequency instead of working with Boston Center to alleviate conflicts. CCC is a busy point with the numerous arrivals to JFK. I reviewed the Letter of Agreement with ZBW and N90 Skydiving and I believe there needs to be some changes. There have been recommendations made in the past to make the jumper aircraft climb North of CCC; but were unsuccessful. I think that if skydive type aircraft want to climb into ZBW airspace then they need to do so north of CCC. If this is not able to be done then they need to remain within 3-5 miles of CCC. Right now the LOA; in my opinion; is not restrictive enough concerning the climbout procedures for these aircraft. That airspace is way too congested with big aircraft to allow skydive activity in that area [to] go unrestricted.",,,,"ZBW Controller described a conflict event when a parachute drop aircraft was instructed to maintain visual separation with an inbound air carrier to JFK.

We were cleared to descend to 3;000 FT.We noticed a hit on our TCAS that was not pointed out by ATC nor made any radio transmissions that we heard. We looked for the traffic; but did not see anything. I actually thought it might have been a ghost hit. We were given a vector to a base leg. While in the turn and leveling off at 3;000 we received an RA. There was an aircraft in our path we could not see (we were looking and I now think he was climbing). We complied with the RA and received a 'clear of conflict' oral message. I immediately informed ATC that we had an RA and had to maneuver the aircraft to avoid collision. I inquired about the traffic. The Controller stated that we had plenty of clearance from the traffic. I was stunned. I felt like we were put in a very bad spot and the Controller did not have a clue. Maybe my bad for thinking a ghost target; but I still had very good SA [Situational Awareness]. We were constantly clearing outside and we were aware of the TA hit on TCAS. We did not know that aircraft's trends. We eventually were within 500 FT of the traffic. I am not saying I am perfect; however; my SA was pretty high. My concern is that we were put in a position that we should not have been put in. We were being vectored to final at one of the nation's busiest airports at night. ATC never pointed out the conflicting traffic. We had SA on hit on TCAS. Controller never said anything. After RA; Controller said 'traffic was not a factor'. I was so upset.

Tower requested a left turn departure for Air Carrier X because a flight of two military jets were ready for departure right behind them. I told Tower to turn Air Carrier X left on a 210 heading. Tower held on to Air Carrier X for a couple minutes on departure climb while the flight of two military jets departed behind them on runway heading. Shortly thereafter; Air Carrier X came over to Departure climbing out of 034 above the MVA for that area I told them to proceed direct HANAA. [I] then told the following military jet flight to turn left direct LAGGS. I performed coordination for the handoff of the military jet flights to Boston Center then switched them. My trainer alerted me that Air Carrier X appeared to be off course. I immediately told Air Carrier X to turn left direct HANAA. This appeared to do nothing; so my trainer keyed up and said turn left heading 220 and called traffic because Air Carrier X was now a direct conflict with the pair of military jets at their 12 to 1 o'clock around 3 to 4 miles and decreasing rapidly within a few hundred feet of each other. Air Carrier X was issued a safety alert and reported the traffic in sight and was told to maintain visual separation. I'm not sure if the pilots of Air Carrier X saw both military jets or just one. The second military jet did not have it's transponder on so it was hard to tell how much of a factor there was between Air Carrier X and the second military jet. It is my understanding that Air Carrier X was in direct conflict because when I told them to proceed direct HANAA; they accidentally put in HANNA. I've been told that this happened before. I believe that a name change should be initiated for this fix or a removal altogether to avoid future mistakes.",,"During the preflight I entered the flight plan after receiving the clearance. I entered HANNA into the flight plan instead of entering HANAA. After completing the flight plan the Captain and I reviewed it and the spelling error of HANAA was missed. On takeoff we were cleared runway heading. Moments later ATC came back with a heading of 210 on takeoff. After climbing out and cleaning up we were assigned a climb to 10;000 and direct to HANAA. The incorrect spelling of HANNA was where the aircraft turned toward (should have been HANAA). Not long after the Controller asked if we were direct HANAA. At this time we discovered the incorrect spelling and entered the correct HANAA. During this time ATC gave us an initial vector and called traffic out. We both saw the traffic and continued a left turn direct to HANAA.",,"A loss of separation event occurred when pronunciation of navigational fix HANAA was apparently incorrectly entered in the FMS as HANNA by the flight crew and an unexpected turn was initiated.",

ATC alerted us to VFR jet traffic; a Cessna Citation; at our approximate 11 o'clock position about 10 miles; descending through our altitude. We were told the traffic had us in sight and would maintain visual separation from us while descending through our altitude. Because we were cruising below the FL180 transition level; we still had all of our external lights illuminated for safety. We reported traffic in sight and noted to each other that the traffic was indeed slightly above us with TCAS indicating a descent. Our cruise speed was 280 KIAS. Assuming the Citation was descending at approximately the same speed; our closure rate was in the neighborhood of 700 KTAS. This means our two aircraft were closing the distance between us at about 5.1 seconds per mile; giving us a little over 50 seconds from the initial ATC call before our aircraft would be over the same spot. Very shortly after the Controller called out the traffic to us; maybe 10-15 seconds; we received a TA from our TCAS. We were monitoring the opposing aircraft both visually and on our TCAS display in the cockpit. A few seconds later; as the opposing aircraft continued its descent directly at our aircraft; our TCAS issued an RA with instruction for us to descend. Because we were monitoring the other aircraft so closely; I almost immediately verbally and physically initiated a climb by pushing the throttles toward the forward stop and raising the nose to 20-25 degrees nose up; similar to a terrain avoidance or windshear escape maneuver. I also made a slight offset to the right to help increase our distance from the opposing aircraft. Within seconds; TCAS showed the opposing aircraft passing directly beneath us with between 200-300 feet of vertical separation. At somewhere around 60-65 tons; initiation of a climb or descent will be met with a momentary lag before a change is realized in aircraft position. Despite the lag; I was able to create vertical separation with the climb; which eventually registered approximately 3;500-4;000 FPM. We eventually topped out at 17;800 feet after less than 30 seconds of climb. It is my professional opinion that initiation of a descent as directed by the TCAS RA would have resulted in a mid-air collision. The RA came as the opposing aircraft was maybe 1.5-2 miles from us and approximately 100 feet above our altitude; continuing its descent through our level altitude. With less than 10 seconds closure remaining and the other aircraft actively descending; a descent on our part would have had to yield several thousand fpm almost immediately for us to beat the opposing aircraft to a lower altitude where we could have safely passed underneath. Before the RA; as we watched this scenario begin to unfold over about a 12 second period; it became obvious to me that a rapid climb was going to be our best escape route; and that is why I flew opposite the RA command in the cockpit. At no time did airspeed decay to an unsafe level. I never saw our speed go below 260 KIAS. The Captain immediately communicated our deviation to ATC (no doubt with my colorful commentary bleeding through in the background) and coordinated a descent back to our originally assigned altitude. We reestablished ourselves on course and continued on to an uneventful approach and landing with no further incident.",,"While level at our cruise altitude of 16;000 feet; ATC called out VFR traffic at 12 o'clock ahead approaching head on to us. The traffic was in sight with landing lights on. Because of our cruise altitude our landing lights were on as well. The traffic called us in sight; as we called them in sight. The traffic had been in a VFR descent and stopped at 17;000 momentarily; as seen on out TCAS. At approximately 7 miles in front of us the traffic began descending below 17;000 feet. When our TCAS alerted to RA; the traffic was showing 300 feet below us and called for a DESCEND NOW Command. Both the First Officer and myself at about the same time realized this would definitely have put our aircraft in a dangerous position as we would have been descending down on top of the descending traffic. I believe I said CLIMB right as the First Officer initiated a climb away from the traffic which increased separation significantly. I notified ATC of the RA Climb; and we leveled off at 17;800. ATC then asked if the traffic was head on and how close? I was convinced had we not climbed our separation would have been minimal.",,"B737 fight crew at 16;000 feet reports a NMAC with a VFR Cessna Citation descending in the opposite direction.

There were a number of other things going on in the area; traffic wise; including a Global Hawk UAV that was holding in airspace on my sector's northern boundary. The supervisors; TMU and military coordinators had been trying to figure out for hours what we were going to do with the UAV because we do not normally work them and have no procedures in place for working them currently. I was distracted by that activity; as well as my regular traffic; including issuing reroutes to two other aircraft; and did not notice that an A380 was head-on with the B757. The two were approximately 1.5-2 minutes from losing separation; and I panicked and told the B757 to start down; no delay through FL340; then turned him 10 left. I realized I had meant to turn him right; so I turned the A380 10 left; also. I then noticed that was not going to be quite enough; so I turned them each another 10 left. I told the B757 to report leaving FL340; then a foreign aircraft asked a question; and I am not sure if I lost separation or not; it was very close. The hit prior to losing separation the B757 was at FL344. By the time the B757 was able to report; he said he was almost through FL330; and they were at 3 miles on my scope.

There was some other departure and VFR traffic in the sector as well. The HTO (31) Radar Controller reached over and pointed out an Aircraft Y descending to FL170 and said 'I'll go under the JFK arrivals'. I said point out approved. I continued to work my traffic. Both of us had planes on vectors; and the traffic was moderate. I had assumed the 31 Controller was aware of the JFK arrival; most notably Aircraft X that was the only one that was a factor. When the conflict alert went off I asked him if he was going to miss my traffic. The two aircraft were at roughly the same altitude and descending on converging courses. When it became apparent that neither of us had positive separation we both issued left turns to our respective aircraft. I thought the turns would be enough to maintain separation; but when it became clear separation would be lost I issued FL200 to Aircraft X in an attempt to gain vertical separation as well. Aircraft X then advised me they had an RA that was telling them to descend. I let them continue the descent and when clear of the traffic cleared them on course to ROBER. This traffic flow is a common procedure in these two sectors. The point out was ambiguous and neither the Sector 31 Controller nor I were clear about the plan for Aircraft Y. I was under the impression he was going to avoid my traffic; the JFK arrivals. I believe now that he was probably under the impression that I was going to descend my traffic reference his traffic. This is a Controller that I have worked with a lot; and was comfortable with his decision making; and that was probably a factor in why I didn't feel the need to question his plan further.

Our plane was had a Garmin GNS430 and a Mode C transponder; we were using the CTAF frequency at PYM at the time. We were planning on entering the traffic pattern at PYM. There was a lot of aircraft flying in under 2;000 FT MSL. A plane called a 4 mile final into Runway 15; we were close to that area and we decided to do a climbing turn to look for the traffic. The winds started to shift to favor [Runway] 24 but the other aircraft in the pattern were not changing runways. We decided to climb up to about 5;000 FT MSL over the shore line and do a few practice maneuvers to wait and let the other aircraft land or change runways.We did our clearing turns and did a few chandelles; steep turns; and lazy eights. On the last lazy eight; as we're returning to wings level we see an aircraft fly very close right under our left wing. It seemed to be about 300 FT below us and within 200 FT horizontally; it might have been closer; but at the rate that it flew under us it was very difficult to tell. I applied full power and made a 60 degree bank right turn immediately to try to avoid this aircraft. We thought it was a light twin. It looked like it made no efforts to evade us. They must have been on with ATC; as they were at 5;000 FT going at least 150 KTS; which would put them in the Boston Bravo in a matter of minutes. After this event; the pattern was clear and we made an uneventful landing. I don't know what was going on in the other aircraft; but with the changing attitude of my aircraft in the lazy eight; and the closing speed of the conflicting traffic; left for about a second to react and turn. The light twin being fast; relatively small; and in the blind spot under our nose was able to get too close without us seeing them. ADS-B would have been invaluable in this situation; as we would be able to see the other aircraft on the display quicker and easier than trying to spot it whilst performing a maneuver.",,,,"A pilot practicing proficiency maneuvers at 5;000 FT prior to a VFR approach to PYM has a near miss with an aircraft which he assumed was IFR because it was not on PYM CTAF.",

As time went on the sector began to get very busy in a matter of a few minutes with JFK arrivals.  I was sequencing two arrivals flows for JFK; TRAIT being the main arrival fix and SEY the secondary.  The aircraft are required to the cross CCC at 120 and 250 knots and most aircraft are descending from FL240.  Aircraft X was second in the string and was behind company Aircraft Y; both had the crossing restriction at CCC.  The aircrafts' descents and speeds were compatible with approximately 8 miles of spacing.  Several JFK arrivals during this time were on vectors and descending to obtain 5 miles of spacing and I was also busy with other aircraft in the sector.As the sector was getting busy and more complex; Aircraft Z called on the frequency and stated he was climbing to eleven - five with jumpers east of the CCC VOR.  Aircraft Z is an aircraft that provides thrill-seekers with jumps in the vicinity of the CCC VOR while JFK arrivals fly over head.  Most times the jump aircraft climbs to VFR/135 but I think the pilot realized I was busy and chose to climb to VFR/115.  There are written procedures in the SOP that cover this jump aircraft.  When Aircraft Z called the two [other aircraft] were east of CCC descending from 150 (approximately) to 120 and Aircraft Z was climbing out of 100-ish  with 2 minutes until jumpers.  At that time I called the traffic and turned Aircraft Y and Aircraft X to ROBER keep the planes away from Aircraft Z.  The aircraft were about 7 to 8 miles apart and unfortunately I didn't give another crossing restriction.  Most aircraft in this situation will cross abeam CCC at 120 and 250 knots.  Meanwhile my attention went back to my spacing and dealing with other aircraft in the sector.  During one of my scans I realized Aircraft X had a 40 knots overtake on Aircraft Y and was southeast of CCC.  Immediately I turned Aircraft X to a 180 heading to keep my 5 miles; both aircraft were at 120 and the conflict had not activated at this time.  As Aircraft X was turning with a halo the conflict went off and the target may have gone inside the 5 mile halo; Aircraft X was turned back to ROBER after the conflict was resolved.  Aircraft Z wasn't the sole reason for this situation but it added to the complexity of the sector.  After working and seeing this aircraft around for many years I feel this aircraft is an accident waiting to happen.  This aircraft should not be allowed to fly near the JFK arrival track or at the very least the aircraft's altitude should be capped at VFR/105.  Nobody likes to work this aircraft when it's busy and the pilots do not like it as well.",,,,"ZBW describes situation where he is distracted by one aircraft while two others lose required separation.",

I filed aircraft type as P28R/U but DIRECT 9B1. I filed and was not able to select VFR-on-top or enter a comment (e.g.; 'training flight'). I did select a VFR altitude; but was assigned 11;000. I did not request VFR-on-top after I was in the air. I was not expecting GPS fixes and expected to fly a visual approach into 9B1. ATC asked me to confirm that I was slant uniform. I confirmed that I was. The next question was how I was navigating DIRECT. I admitted that I had an iPad for GPS but that it was not an IFR system. I was instructed to proceed direct DREEM. I tried DREAM in my iPad; but did not find the waypoint. I advised ATC that I was unable to find it and asked for a vector. I was given a vector which appeared to be my current heading. Had ATC spelled DREEM for me; I probably would have found it. I was flying in VMC at all times and descended from 11;000 FT to 9;000 FT; then to 7;000 FT maintaining VFR. Shortly after I leveled out at 7;000 FT; ATC instructed me to descend to 5;000 FT and proceed DIRECT DREEM. I was looking for DREAM on the IFR low altitude chart on my iPad. ATC advised that there was traffic at 12:00; to turn left to 360; and warned that I had descended below assigned altitude. I was able to see the other aircraft and immediately turned left and began climbing back to 5;000 FT. I reported to ATC that I had the traffic in sight. After returning to 5;000 FT; I believe I was back to Boston Center who advised that there was a possible pilot deviation and that the next controller would probably be asking me to call number. When handed back to Bradley Approach; I advised that I had located DREEM (on low IFR chart) and was told to proceed direct to DREEM. I know that it is not unusual for a Controller to 'chew out' a pilot for a mistake. But not all controllers do this. This was my first time being chewed out. My observation is that it was a bad idea. Even though I tried to remain calm; I found that it had caused me to be stressed and made it harder to focus on my landing. I think the chewing out should have waited until I was safely on the ground. I believe that chewing out a pilot in the air compromises safety. I should have cancelled IFR earlier. ATC should have given me vectors rather than a GPS fix based on my type '/U'. ATC might have inquired whether I wished to proceed VFR. This was a case where I did not know the best way for ATC to continue navigation. My original clearance was DIRECT 9B1. The primary cause of my failure to stop descent was my attention diverted to finding a GPS waypoint when I had not briefed GPS waypoints and did not have the spelling. Also contributing to the event was my filing direct to my destination which left ATC expecting that I had GPS. ATC should have been able to recover by treating me as having a GPS failure or GPS outage. Repeated instructions from ATC for me to proceed DIRECT DREEM created a sense of necessity to find DREAM on the map which distracted me from the important duty of leveling out at 5;000 FT. The difference between DREEM and 9B1 would have been a very slight heading change. I probably could have proceeded on course or flown 1 or 2 degrees left of course. Finding DREEM was probably quite unnecessary. In retrospect; I wish I had cancelled IFR when ATC asked me how I was navigating.",,,,"PA28 pilot reports filing an IFR flight plan /U direct to his destination in a non IFR aircraft using an iPad for navigation.

A VFR helicopter on a discrete code was east of BDR by approximately 5 miles; heading approximately 060; indicating 3;000 feet when I released Aircraft X.  At approx XX00Z; without coordination or warning; the VFR helicopter suddenly turned to a heading of approximately 330; towards JSD; and began descending.   While this heading was sufficient to keep the helicopter out of BDR's Class D airspace; it would put the helicopter only approximately 0.1 NM outside of it.  More importantly; the helicopter was descending into the BDR departure corridor; just as Aircraft X was becoming airborne.  When Aircraft X checked in on the frequency; I instructed him to maintain 2;000 feet and indent; at this point the helicopter was indicating approximately 2;500 feet just east of the departure corridor for BDR RWY 6; and I was expecting JSD Tower to instruct the helicopter to maintain that altitude until west of the departure corridor.  Instead; the helicopter continued descending; again; no coordination; no point-out; and no communication from JSD Tower; towards the departing Aircraft X.  I had to issue an evasive turn to the southeast (heading 120) to Aircraft X and issue a Safety Alert.  Targets merged 5 NM northeast of BDR (MILUM intersection); both aircraft indicating 2;000 feet.  This is an on-going problem with JSD Tower; whereby N90 controllers have to give evasive maneuvers to IFR aircraft under our control to avoid VFR helicopters under JSD Tower's control.

It was immediately necessary to increase my rate of turn to the right to increase the distance between my plane and the UAV. Given the occasional IMC while flying in and out of cloud layers; it was impossible to see and avoid the UAV at any point prior. With our flight path; speed; and changing direction; it was difficult to ascertain the speed and direction at which the UAV was traveling given the short duration of the encounter; but it appeared as though it may have been traveling in a southerly direction. The UAV was not of a style with wings or a tail; but rather a drum-shaped version grey in color. This is clearly a case that highlights a severe deficiency in the safe operation of the NAS. There was no way for ATC or the equipment in the aircraft to sense the presence of the UAV; and there was most certainly no way to see and avoid it while in IMC. Since this encounter happened at an altitude that was less than 10;000 FT above Class C airspace; an operating transponder was a mandatory piece of equipment.

Cape handed me off to the tower who advised me to report a right downwind entry. From my direction of flight a right base would have been a better line up. I requested a right base and was granted same.  There were multiple aircraft in the area to both land and takeoff. It became clear as I approached that a right base would put me in conflict with another aircraft on a right base further out to my left. I advised the tower that I thought a right downwind would in fact be better and he concurred and I altered course for the right downwind. While on approach and established parallel to the runway on the right downwind at or near pattern altitude the tower controller requested I extend my downwind for other aircraft. I acknowledged same. In a split second out of the corner of my eye I saw another aircraft to my left (Aircraft Y) on a right base. Aircraft Y passed underneath me by a very slim margin; less than 200 feet; perhaps less than 100 feet. It was very quick. If we had been at the same altitude we would have collided. I advised the tower controller of the event and the only response was 'that's why I told you to extend the downwind' The airport went from quiet to extremely busy in a very short period of time. I am not sure if the controller did not know of Aircraft Y's position or if I misinterpreted my instructions but if the latter I did repeat everything and I believe the controller acknowledged same. I was expecting Aircraft Y to be inside my position and not outside my position. My attention was focused towards the airport with only occasional glances to my left. I was asked once again to extend the downwind and continued the downwind to fall in behind a PC-12 on final; the rest of the flight was uneventful. I don't know how the pilot of Aircraft Y could have missed me; I was right in front of him.

One other aircraft was in the pattern as I taxied; and I held short for his landing on runway 26.  When he reported clear of the runway; I announced that I was taking runway 26 for a downwind departure.  No other traffic was visible in the pattern or making calls on CTAF at this point.  After takeoff and still on my departure leg; another aircraft called to announce that he was going to make a crosswind entry to the pattern.  Thinking he might not have heard my initial call from the ground; I announced my crosswind turn and restated my intention to make a downwind departure.  Hearing no response; I decided to climb through pattern altitude and keep an eye out for traffic entering the pattern.  I was at or past pattern altitude as I turned downwind.  Once established on a climbing downwind; I spotted the traffic on the midfield crosswind; I estimate 200 or 300 feet below me.  I called that I had him in sight and was continuing my climb; at this point he was turning left onto the downwind and I lost sight of him below me.  Had I remained at pattern altitude and we had continued our courses; this would have been a _very_ close encounter.  At this point an aircraft operating over Lake Winnipesaukee called to announce his position since I was climbing towards the lake.  This then took my attention; I acknowledged his call and stated my further intentions.  There was no further contact or conflict with traffic in the pattern. My initial reaction to the encounter is to admonish the other pilot for not listening or showing situational awareness.  CTAF is great for making traffic advisories; but it's just as good for hearing traffic advisories.  Listen; because that other voice might be announcing that they're coming at you! On review; there are a couple of things I could have done differently.  First; I could have changed my plan and departed the pattern to the west and turned on course once I was well clear of the pattern.  My hesitation to do this came from the fact that I had already announced my intention to depart downwind; and if anyone else was listening; that's what they were expecting me to do.  Especially after my second call; I felt that it was more sensible to be predictable and to keep an eye out for traffic I knew was there rather than to change my plan and surprise traffic that was paying attention.  I also hoped -- expected; in fact -- that the other aircraft would respond or at least keep a sharp eye out.  So in hindsight perhaps I should have departed the pattern earlier; but I don't second guess my decision at the time.  I suspect I'll be debating this point with myself for some time to come. Second; and much less ambiguous; was my decision to continue my climb on downwind after I lost sight of the other aircraft under me.  My assumption was that he would stay at pattern altitude and turn base while I kept climbing straight ahead (terrain makes it difficult for me to turn right at this point).  In my head; separation was assured; and that was the end of it.  But why would I choose to lose sight of an aircraft with only a few hundred feet vertical separation?!  It would have taken some maneuvering to keep him in sight at that point; but without a two-way dialog on CTAF and without visual contact; an assumption and a mental picture isn't the best thing to rely on.",,,,"Light aircraft pilot reported NMAC with another light aircraft on departure from LCI.",

My intent was to descend him to 11;000 feet once he entered my airspace in 1 minute.  I took the handoff on Aircraft Y; who was about 20 miles west of GIGTY at 17;000 feet; eastbound towards GIGTY (I thought).  As I was about to issue Aircraft X a descent clearance; another aircraft; Aircraft Z; questioned a clearance that I had issued to him earlier.  Aircraft Z was originally told to 'Descend via the ROBUC1 Arrival; Runway 33L; resume published speed at BANKI.'  When he was about 6 miles west of Aircraft X he said that he had been given direct ROBUC by the previous controller and asked where he should resume published speed.  I immediately advised the Aircraft Z to maintain FL230; as Aircraft Z could have descended to 11;000 feet.  There is a published window of FL210-230 at GIGTY on the ROBUC STAR.  The next published altitude for an aircraft direct ROBUC is KRANN between 13;000 feet and 11;000 feet.  I was never told verbally or via automation that Aircraft Z was direct ROBUC.  So; I guess that unexpected exchange must have blown a circuit in my brain or something.  Because I completely forgot about descending Aircraft X.  That; combined with a 130 tailwind for Aircraft Y; led to the two aircraft getting close much faster than I expected them to.  I had diverted my attention to the D-Side to fix two routes on a couple of air taxis going from KBED to KISM.  While I was doing that; the Boston High controller; said to me in a loud voice; 'You have two at seventeen.'  I glanced back at the scope and immediately told Aircraft X to descend and maintain 11;000 feet; expedite.  He acknowledged and I then instructed Aircraft Y to turn 50 degrees right; expedite; and issued traffic.  Aircraft Y responded that he was climbing in response to a TCAS RA.  I said roger; but I still need you to turn right (to go behind his traffic.)  Aircraft Y refused the turn; climbed; and I believe that; combined with the expedited descent from Aircraft X; I never lost 3 miles (which we are allowed to use in that area).Links in a chain:  Number 1; I should have gotten control for descent on Aircraft X as soon as I saw the handoff coming my way on Aircraft Y.  Normally there is plenty of time to take care of it in your own airspace.  But that wind aloft was huge and Aircraft Y was converging much quicker than normal.  Normally; he would have passed behind Aircraft X by at least 3 miles.  That's why I wasn't worried.  Number 2.  Sector 19 should have left the ROBUC STAR aircraft on the procedure as required by SOP.  If they had; the Aircraft Z never would have questioned his clearance and I would not have been thrown off my rhythm. Number 3.  It would be nice; if carriers filed a preferential route.  If they had; then I wouldn't have been changing their routes. Number 4.  I've been doing this long enough that numbers 1; 2; and 3 should never be enough to cause this to happen.  I failed to ensure separation.  I got distracted when I shouldn't have.  I had 4 airplanes on my frequency; so this was inexcusable.  This is a humbling job.

In the vicinity of UROWT intersection northwest of Boston; we listened to a conversation between Boston Approach and a VFR 'Research' Aircraft Y that was loitering VFR on the STAR corridor at 15;500 feet.  ATC was attempting to move the aircraft out of the arrival area for traffic but Aircraft Y requested to stay on that station for the next hour.  ATC then vectored an aircraft directly in front of us 30 degrees left of course to avoid Aircraft Y.  We anticipated that we would also be vectored off the arrival and shortly after; we were given vectors 30 degrees left of course and advised of the traffic at 15;500 Feet.  We were at approximately 17;000 Feet descending in order to meet the altitude restrictions of the STAR.  Without warning or advising ATC; Aircraft Y turned directly toward us which rapidly triggered a TCAS Resolution Advisory for us to CLIMB.  We immediately reversed the descent and began a climb and advised ATC that we were responding to an resolution advisory (RA).  We observed a 300 foot altitude difference between us and the RED TCAS icon at the closest proximity.  Lateral proximity appeared to be about 1 mile.  The 'Clear of Conflict' message was not heard until we had climbed well above the traffic; to approximately FL180.  We then were re-cleared to resume the arrival although we were unable to descend in time to meet at least one of the at or below altitude restrictions.  Once re-established on the arrival; we landed uneventfully. Suggestions1.  Although we anticipated a vector away from the traffic; an altitude re-clearance above the conflict and release from altitude descent restriction by ATC could have been an easier; faster; and safer way to resolve the traffic conflict.2.  Although ATC is always trying to accommodate VFR traffic requests; in my view the request by the 'Research' Aircraft Y should have been denied until ATC was able to better coordinate a long-term plan for the Aircraft Y's lengthy request to remain on that station and should have given the VFR traffics instructions to advise all changes in altitude or heading.",,,,"A Corporate Captain reported taking evasive action from a VFR Small Transport; High Wing; 2 Turboprop Engine near 15;500 Feet while descending on the QUABN3 arrival to BOS at night after ATC allowed the aircraft to remain in the arrival corridor.",

Traffic volume started to increase a little; but workload was already elevated because of deviations and pilots asking for route and weather information. I had several aircraft in the vicinity of NELIE and HFD; most needing to move through each other; of course. I recall Aircraft X was landing ASH and was direct GDM at 17;000. Aircraft Y aircraft in question was destined for HPN and flying direct NELIE and descending to 16;000. I had cleared Aircraft X direct to GDM to ensure he crossed behind the path of another aircraft which was descending to cross WIPOR at 11;000. Another aircraft; Aircraft Z; I believe; had just crossed in front of the path of Aircraft X at 16;000; destined for TEB.  That aircraft had been shortcut to SAGES intersection for weather avoidance; and I remember wondering whether or not Aircraft Z would go fast enough to remain in front of Aircraft Y aircraft until their paths diverged. Aircraft Z remained sufficiently in front; and the aircraft descending towards WIPOR was about to leave 15;000. At that moment; I apparently forgot about Aircraft Y I had been watching just a moment ago; because I instructed Aircraft X to descend to 16;000. (I had to eventually get them to 11;000.) A second or two later; I realized I had issued a descent right into the path of Aircraft Y and for the same altitude. Aircraft X either had not yet started down or had only begun to descend when I came up with something like 'Don't descend; maintain 17;000.' I was shaken in the immediate aftermath of that clearance because it was an obvious traffic conflict that would have resulted in the aircraft possibly passing within a mile of each other; and I completely blanked for a long enough to issue a clearance to 16;000; regardless of the fact that I resolved the situation just a few seconds later. It was around that time the supervisor had a returning controller take sector 34 from me; which brings us to part II.  The briefing to the controller taking sector 34 was broken and interrupted.

The plan was to leave Aircraft X on the route until they passed the unknown VFR's then descend below Aircraft Y while there was still plenty of lateral separation.  I had to turn Aircraft X early to avoid an unknown VFR that started climbing.  That turn created conflict with Aircraft Y.  Aircraft X was instructed to expedite descent to 2;500 feet to get below Aircraft Y.  Aircraft X was slow to descend so additional turns were given and Aircraft Y was instructed to climb.  Separation was maintained but it was an ugly operation.

I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed the 'bird' over land; but it stood out against the deep blue-green of the harbor. And its wings weren't flapping. Oops. I then quickly recognized the familiar shape of a toy; it was a DJI Phantom drone. Because it was well beneath us; no avoidance maneuvering was necessary; but I called out its position to the Captain Pilot Flying (PF) and then to BOS Tower; who quickly relayed the alert to traffic following us on the approach; and who; after we landed; asked me to phone the Tower Supervisor with details; which I did. Although no maneuvering was necessary; the sighting and relaying of the drone's location clearly distracted from my other duties during one of the most critical phases of flight. I've spoken with several other Pilots who know friends and neighbors with drones; or who have purchased one for themselves or their children. I would hope they all realize that the very dense and heavy nature of the batteries on these machines are going to cause far greater damage than a bird of equivalent weight; when one finally; and it seems inevitably; impacts a windscreen; jet engine; or flap assembly. It's going to be ugly; and we really need to spread the word. So I would urge anyone reading this who operate drones; to ask them to visit http://knowbeforeyoufly.org and make sure they fully understand where and when drones are appropriate. Because of its altitude; I wouldn't be surprised if the one we saw had been launched in complete innocence off a boat in the harbor; simply to take photos or videos of the boat's owners.It may to be one of the most harmless drone/aircraft encounters on record; yet it was still; if for no other reason than the distraction; a hazard to air navigation.",,,,"B737 First Officer reports a drone at 800 feet AGL during approach to Runway 4R at BOS.

Both aircraft were in a constant high speed descent from initial contact so no speeds were issued because it would have been impossible to slow and still make the approach altitude. Aircraft Y was approximately 6 miles behind Aircraft X when turned onto final. I knew of the speed difference; at the time Aircraft X was indicating about 170 on a 5 mile final. Aircraft Y was indicating about 270 turning onto the 11 mile final. I had two IFR popups that had to be issued around the same time. I issued one and then took a coordination call from ZBW about a conflict they were pointing out between two aircraft they had just handed me off at 070; both just on the border of my airspace. I observed the continued speed overtake just before I took the call but thought that Aircraft Y would be slowing anyway and that I would have time to take the call; then go back and adjust speed if necessary. After hanging up I observed Aircraft Y on a 5 nm final indicating 260KT with Aircraft X about 4 nm ahead indicating 140KT. I issued reduce speed to 170KT to Aircraft Y; to which I received the reply; 'we are slowing' leading me to believe they were already trying to slow down but not very successfully due to the rate of descent. At 3.3 nm separation I cancelled Aircraft Y approach clearance and climbed and turned him to the North. Separation decreased to 2.83 nm and 900ft prior to divergence. In this situation I trusted that Aircraft Y would be slower than they actually were due to the proximity to the airport but the high speed descent prevented that from happening. Due to volume and complexity I elected to turn them on final 6 nm behind Aircraft X rather than go through and turn right back because I didn't have time to explain and issue that; and thought that the distance would be adequate with a normal approach speed. A lack of airspace contributed to the high speed descent. I was unable to turn Aircraft Y to the right to make a longer final due to airspace; unable to turn left prior to that because of crossing traffic and I was worried about going through the final due to parachute jumping 5 SE of the final approach course on Aircraft Y's current heading. The design of the airspace and routes in this area is inherently flawed. Both Aircraft X and Aircraft Y were taken off a descend via clearance due to crossing traffic just ahead handed off from ZBW as well; I had to call them to request the heading prior to handoff. On this arrival routing conflicts are built in because of crossing traffic right at the sector boundary. Until ZBW puts the aircraft in handoff status we are not aware of the potential conflicts; requiring almost no preplanning time and immediate call for alternative action upon seeing the handoff flash. Further complicating the situation is the MHT arrivals are on a VNAV descent where the conflict point is not always known and vertical separation cannot be ensured. I recommend changing the arrival STAR by pushing it north by 5nm to deconflict this area. On Runway 6 there is little to no opportunity to sequence aircraft because of the airspace limitations; crossing traffic and parachute activity. Speed control is highly ineffective because of the high speed descent profile and short distance to the final approach course from initial contact.",,,,"A90 TRACON Controller reported of a loss of separation of final due to speed control.

The first; Center asked if we had traffic to our right in sight; and we did briefly until going into the clouds. He suggested 20 degrees right for traffic; which I queried; as that would send us directly into the traffic. He confirmed; so we turned; thinking he had the bigger picture and had positive control over the other aircraft. This gave us a descend RA; which we complied with; until it was clear of conflict. We informed ATC and then returned to our original altitude. At 6;000 feet; just past LEMOR; we saw a rapidly climbing target on our TCAS from below on a direct course with our aircraft. We asked ATC about it and he was busy and said 'he just popped up.' At the time; we were IMC in the clouds and has negative contact on that aircraft. When the target was 300 feet below us; a mile or less directly in front of us; the RA directed us to descend. Immediately followed it; then realized that would send us into the offending traffic and then evasively banked to the right and initiated a climb. As soon as I initiated this maneuver; the TCAS (while zoomed into 6 miles as well) indicates the target as same altitude and same location. His target was spot on the middle of the TCAS. This was all done in the clouds with a VFR target. We once again informed ATC and continued on our way after recovering safely. I requested a number from Approach and called them after the flight. I spoke to a very nice gentleman who explained to me that it's a known issue. The offending airplane was a [skydive service aircraft]. This aircraft has 900hp and a 4 bladed prop; so it climbs like a rocket through the clouds and the airways. He let me know that unfortunately nothing can be done about it; and recommended I talk to [the] Quality Control Supervisor. We had a constructive conversation regarding the incidents and both agreed that; unfortunately; the only regulation broken was the VFR Caravan flying into the clouds. That however; would be my word vs the skydive pilot and that would go nowhere. [I was provided] with the radar tracks and the closest separation is as follows:6;000 feet; 1.39 miles horizontal; 100 feet vertical; then 1.04 and 100; then 'less than a mile' 100 vertical. Fortunately TCAS saved us on the first one and a solid flight crew and good CRM saved 47 lives on the Dash and a dozen on the skydive plane.Skydive planes shouldn't be allowed to climb through clouds; through airways; and drop skydivers through them. It's extremely dangerous and will eventually cause an accident.",,,,"A Dash 8 Captain reported an airborne conflict with a skydive service aircraft that was climbing VFR through clouds.",

As a result of this training I believe the some aircraft were out of an efficient/good position for the approach sequence.  I attempted to fix this situation which contributed to complexity.  I was working multiple sectors/frequency in which frequency congestion was apparent with aircraft stepping on one another.  Aircraft Y; VFR requested a practice approach.  I advised the aircraft to expect vectors for the sequence as he was going to be delayed slightly due to other inbound traffic.  I assigned Aircraft Y a vector west for the final and restricted his altitude at or below 2;500.  The aircraft was level and 2;500 and never deviated from that altitude.  Inbound from the west was Aircraft X; IFR. Aircraft X was issued a heading to parallel final due to slower aircraft on the approach; and was issued a decent to 3;000 from 5;000.  Aircraft X leveled at 3;000 for a few miles and I issued a turn for a box pattern to base.  Aircraft X level at 3;000 and Aircraft Y level and restricted at or below 2;500 appeared to be converging and traffic was issued to Aircraft X.  At approximately 1 mile apart Aircraft X started descending and advised they were responding to an RA.  This response to the RA caused a Lack Of Separation Standards (LOSS) and created a real collision hazard. There was no other traffic in the immediate area.It is my understanding that certain company policies require pilot action with regards to a TCAS RAs however in this instance it caused a potential collision that was otherwise a controlled and safe operation.

During the event in question we were in IMC with no meaningful visibility outside the aircraft. From 4;000 feet we received a descent clearance to 3;500 feet. As we initiated the descent; Approach issued a traffic advisory for opposite direct VFR traffic [around] 3;000 feet. Descending through about 3;700 feet Approach advised that the traffic appeared to be climbing and instructed us to stop the descent. Almost simultaneously; the TCAS began issuing aural traffic alerts. I estimate that from the time Approach issued the 'stop descent' instruction until we were able to arrest the descent of the aircraft we had descended another 150 feet. Once I had identified the conflicting traffic on the TCAS screen I found that it was very close (in front of us) laterally and converging vertically. I initiated a climb; which approach instructed a moment later. At closest approach on the TCAS screen; I could discern no lateral separation and the target icon reported the other aircraft as 400 feet below us. Once clear of the traffic; we received clearance for a descent to 3;000 feet and emerged into VMC around that altitude.When I later informed Approach that our TCAS had indicated a very close pass with only 400 feet of vertical separation; the controller indicated that the traffic had departed BED westbound; was squawking VFR and not in contact with Approach. (I find myself wondering if the other aircraft ever realized how close 20;000 pounds worth of our airplane had come traveling nearly head-on.)More notes regarding the event:-The screen of the model of TCAS installed in this airplane is fairly small and dim. At maximum brightness I find it satisfactory in night operations; but sometimes difficult to read in the day. The airspace around Boston is congested; and the conflicting target did not begin to stand out to my eyes until the commencement of aural advisories and the icon changed color. Needless to say; however; it would still pay to check the TCAS screen carefully prior to initiating altitude changes.-Also; possibly due to the volume of radio traffic; my PF First Officer did not evidently hear the 'stop descent' instruction from the controller. A moment was required before I realized this and took action. As a result; we had descended another 150 feet before stopping the descent.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported an NMAC on arrival to BED with a VFR departure out of the same airport.",

Immediately once the traffic passed through 1000 feet below us in a steady climb; we queried Approach about traffic at our 12 o'clock and a mile or two and climbing. Once the traffic hit 400 feet below us and directly ahead of us; I didn't wait for ATC to respond but immediately turned off the autopilot and advised ATC we were making an immediate turn to the west.

RWY 23 was active and Aircraft X was in the right downwind. Aircraft Y was on the right base to RWY 23. Aircraft X was instructed to make a left 360 when they were midfield. As they were rolling out of the 360 I pointed the aircraft out to the developmental. She instructed them to make another tight left 360 and they acknowledged. We did not tell Aircraft Y about Aircraft X in a 360 abeam the numbers. We did tell Aircraft X about Aircraft Y and they would be number 3 to follow. I told the trainee traffic for one is traffic for another but we never called it on frequency.We had an aircraft on short final so I scanned gear and the RWY. A helicopter was operating on the east side of the airspace. They called up to tell us they were tracking RT3 northbound and they were going to be hovering on about a 3 mile final for RWY23. As I scanned back to the northwest; Aircraft Y keyed up and said they had traffic directly ahead and inquired what they were doing. They also said they took evasive maneuvers to avoid. At this point I keyed up let Aircraft Y know the traffic was now behind them and they were cleared to land. I told Aircraft X they were #2 and cleared to land. I saw out the window what was happening but the helicopter was still talking blocking the frequency. Aircraft X flew at least another mile in the downwind from when being instructed to make a 360 and when they started it. Aircraft X complied with the first 360 appropriately.The ATM and two people for an ECV audit were upstairs. Additionally; the CIC/GC/FD positions were combined and there was a position relief briefing in progress. A90 had called twice over the shout line to coordinate an arrival to RWY29 at the same time. Change my scanning techniques. I saw Aircraft X abeam the numbers and they went to the rwy. The helicopter called so I looked and scanned their flight path before going back to Aircrafts X and Y.

When we got switched over to the final Boston approach controller on 124.4; it was immediately evident that he had his hands full with many airplanes on the frequency. Several of the planes on frequency sounded as though they didn't have a lot of radio experience (slow responses; non-concise read backs; etc) which made the situation more difficult. BED was landing on runway 11; we were getting vectored to the west of the airport. As we passed abeam the north side of BED we called the airport in sight; but were not cleared for a visual approach. I believe this is because the controller was working another plane through an IFR approach which conflicted with the airspace we would have required to conduct our visual to 11 at KBED. He even asked the plane to cancel IFR so he could use the airspace. While this was happening we ended up considerably farther west of KBED than we normally would get vectored for a visual approach. The controller finally gave us a base turn and as we progressed he issued several traffic callouts to us as well. As we were turning final (approximately 10 miles out) we were given a traffic call of a target 1 o'clock at a lower altitude and both of us looked and saw an airplane that appeared to have departed from [a nearby airport]. I called the traffic in sight. The controller then said something about another target and instructed us to turn left heading 090 (a left turn) which the Pilot Flying began to do with the autopilot engaged. As soon as he began to bank to the left; he saw another airplane coming up right in front of us moving right to left so he disengaged the autopilot and immediately rolled back to the right to avoid it. He said later he thought if we had continued the turn to the left we probably would have collided. I told the controller that was way too close and he replied that the plane had come from [a nearby airport] and climbed up underneath us. We saw many targets on our TCAS display; but we never got any warning about the one that nearly ran into us. We came to learn later that our TCAS can only issue an RA if both airplanes are TCAS equipped. As to why we didn't get a TA either; we can only guess that since the plane had just taken off our TCAS didn't have enough time to acquire the target and identify it as a threat.Further discussions with Boston TRACON afterwards confirmed to us that the shape of the Class B airspace around KBOS is such that it forces all of the GA traffic in the area into the west side and right through the approach path to runway 11 at KBED. This is an extremely unsafe situation with jets at 2;000 feet going 200 knots getting vectored for approach are mixed in with all sorts of small GA traffic that has no requirement to contact ATC. 'See and avoid' gets a little ridiculous when they are issuing traffic calls to us almost constantly and we think we see the one they are talking about and yet there is another one climbing right up into our path. Departing a satellite airports should have a requirement to contact either KBED Tower or Boston Approach so they are also aware of what is around them. The Class D airspace around KBED should be extended out to the west to protect the airplanes on approach. There are just too many airplanes in that area for 'see and avoid' to be considered adequate. It is only a matter of time before there is a mid-air collision rather than a near-miss like we had.",,"I was the pilot-flying with the following conditions: Autopilot engaged; heading on 110 degrees (lined-up with Runway 11 KBED); altitude level at 2;000 feet; and radio on frequency 124.4 (Boston Approach). VMC conditions prevailed the entire arrival route which had been a vectored extended left downwind for Runway 11 coming from the Northeast. We were just about to start our final approach when we were given instructions to look for traffic off our right side. Pilot not-flying gained visual contact with traffic and acknowledged it to Approach. Then Boston Approach gave us instructions to turn to the left for traffic. I started turning the heading knob to commence a left turn and; as I was looking for any additional traffic off our left side; I quickly noticed a small single-engine airplane coming into my view as the roll was started. The other airplane appeared to be below me; slightly to my left; and in a climb. I quickly disengaged the autopilot and rolled the wings to the right to avoid hitting the airplane. I felt no altitude change was necessary and maintained 2000 feet. No TCAS warnings; TA or RA; were alerted by our Honeywell TCAS-2000 system. We notified Boston of the additional traffic and then got back on track for our final approach to Runway 11. A safe landing was completed without any other events occurring after the near collision.I believe that more awareness of the presence of heavy corporate traffic overhead when winds are favoring Runway 11 at KBED needs to be expressed to anyone conducting operations at [a satellite airport]. Also; the awareness of making sure Mode C is turned on when operating within the 30nm ring of KBOS.",,"A jet aircraft crew on approach to BED described the VFR traffic conflicts in the crowded airspace below BOS Class B.",

After a minute or two I observed the aircraft at 085 and queried the pilot on his altitude. At the same time I noticed a primary target about 3 miles away.

We coordinated for a left turn direct ENE (approximately at 060 heading). Aircraft Z was on the downwind for a practice approach to Runway 34 working with the PSM Ground Control Approach (GCA). The tower called to get an additional departure out opposite direction ahead of Aircraft X and Y. As that departure came out the GCA put Aircraft Z on a base to a 10 mile final; then turned them on to the localizer inbound. Aircraft X flight checked in 1 mile south of PSM. I kept him climbing and asked to verify he was in a left turn and called traffic for Aircraft Z on a 7 mile final. Aircraft X made his turn to the northeast about 2.5 nm south of PSM at which time I observed Aircraft Y departing. I observed Aircraft Y out of 2500 feet and then turning northeastbound. Aircraft Z was about 2 miles away at 2;000 feet at which point the approach was broken off and he was turned to the northwest. Closest proximity was about 2.0 nm and 600ft. It was obvious to me that Aircraft Z would need to be broken off the approach as soon as he was turned inbound and I kept expecting the GCA to turn him away but they didn't until it was too late. We are required by Letter of Agreement to give the PSM GCA all opposite direction aircraft when they are open for service. They do not have the same cut-off opposite direction rules we do; I don't know what rules they use. I should not have trusted them to take more positive action when it was clear the situation wasn't going to work. There wasn't much I could do with the aircraft I was working due to it being a flight of two with the first aircraft clear of conflict and the second one being the trouble point.

Nothing was done. A third controller left from the shift early; bringing us to 8. Nothing was done. A fourth controller left sick later. From what I understand; the FLM [Front Line Manager] had requested overtime; but the OMIC [Operations Manager In Charge] declined. Thanks for the help.I was performing OJTI [On The Job Training Instruction] duties at sectors 34 and 47; combined. We did not have a D-side at first; but a D-rated developmental was assigned later. The supervisor had asked whether or not I wanted to have the sectors split; and I had replied that I did not because it was beneficial (at the time) for training to leave them combined. Things were manageable. Things changed.Traffic levels increased beyond what was prudent for leaving the sectors combined or for conducting training; but the sectors were not split - it seems by then that we no longer had staffing available to split the sectors. We were trying to make the best of the situation as far as training went; but the situation was becoming overwhelming. We had been on position for 1+30 to 1+40 and the sector had been red for a large portion of that time. I hesitated to take the situation from the developmental because it felt like they were only just a little behind the curve and could sufficiently work through it; given the chance.The developmental ended up accepting a handoff on Aircraft Y; overflying PVD westbound on his route to TEB; after issuing a 'descend via' clearance to Aircraft X; who was overflying PROVI eastbound - which overlies PVD - on their way to BOS. The developmental did not discern these aircraft to be a conflict at the time they accepted the handoff; and I subsequently identified the conflict to the developmental and our D-side. The D-side had apparently asked my developmental if they wanted anything to be done with Aircraft Y; but the developmental declined. I hadn't heard this. We were busy enough; actually; that I didn't immediately notice the developmental had taken the handoff on Aircraft Y. As soon as I did; I pointed it out. The 'right (only)' move was to go left with Aircraft Y; but the developmental turned the aircraft right heading 360. This ended up only being a 20 or 30 degree turn - and it was into Aircraft X's path rather than away. I immediately said that the developmental should have gone left; and then experienced an apparent large lapse in judgement and elected to try to help the developmental force their plan to work. It was a bad plan; but I didn't immediately recognize how bad. I directed the developmental to have Aircraft X expedite his descent; which they (the trainee) did. I directed them to climb Aircraft Y from 160 to FL200; which they did. However; the pilot of Aircraft Y did not climb. I took over the radio at that point and turned Aircraft X left to 030. I'd waited too long; it was not enough to maintain 3-mile radar separation. Aircraft Y came back to us a little after and wanted to clarify he was to climb to FL200. We confirmed that he had been cleared to climb. I'm pretty sure he read the initial clearance back; though I can't say whether or not it would have saved separation. It would have been better; anyway.1) Stop shorting us (staffing) to the point we can't open/split sectors we NEED to have open for safety! What's our priority?2) If we could not provide adequate staffing/sector configuration; the traffic should have been slowed to a more manageable level. Mileage-in-trail restrictions; minutes-in-trail; and other TMU initiatives should have been put in place; but were not.Bad judgement happens. It happens more frequently when you're tired; stressed; and pressed. We were all of those things.

Winds variable from calm to 8 kts for 45 minutes prior to landing shifting from northwest to southwest. No response from airport management on UNICOM to repeated requests from me and others for airport advisory; despite airport maintenance vehicle making several calls when crossing runway. AFD (Airport/Facility Directory) has seemingly nonstandard language that turned out to be confusing for some on what runway to use during calm wind conditions. When I was 7 miles SW; ASOS reported winds calm. I took AFD statement to mean that runway 22 is preferred runway when winds reported as less than 5 kts. I set up for a left downwind to 22. An aircraft called in from the South and prepared to; and proceeded to land runway 4 despite 5 other aircraft approaching/in pattern for runway 22. Someone asked on frequency why the aircraft would choose to use runway 4 when the runway in use is 22. The aircraft responded that he took off earlier that morning and the winds favored runway 4; that's what he considered the safest runway; and that he asserted there was no calm wind runway at the airport despite my popping in to report that AFD says Runway 22 is the calm wind runway. Given the total of 7 aircraft approaching/in the pattern (including me) from all directions simultaneously (one crossed perpendicular to me; 300 ft above pattern altitude; as part of his pattern entry); I did not have a visual on the runway 4 aircraft until I turned final. Since he was closer to landing than me; and appeared insistent on landing; I shifted right and went around (above the landing aircraft). I suspect that the landing aircraft may have been a local pilot given his statement on CTAF and where he taxied to on the airport. Can the AFD language be changed for greater clarity in this situation? Can airport management provide typical Unicom services on runway in use? While the largest aircraft in the pattern during my arrival was a King Air; the ramp was filled with mid and large cabin jets. It's also an air carrier airport.

During approach and landing at the airport; it was observed that there were glider operations occurring on the grass to the South side of the active runway 25. The student and I landed the plane on runway 25 and taxied back to the takeoff end of the runway in preparation for our next leg of the trip. While checking our plane and adjusting instruments; a tow plane with a glider announced that they were taking off on runway 25 with a glider in tow. As we continued to check and set up our plane; the glider tow plane announced that they had released the glider. We continued with our pre-flight checks; scanned the area and waited for another plane to land on runway 25. Once we were ready for takeoff; both the student and I again scanned the runway approach and departure paths for traffic. We noticed that the released glider was coming in for a landing onto the grass to the south of runway 25 where the glider operations were in progress. The approach that the glider was taking placed it sufficiently to the side of the runway so as not to interfere with our departure. The approach path of the glider was to the south of Runway 25 and in a direction directly opposite to runway 25 (parallel to runway 7). This placed the glider directly looking in the direction of the departure end of runway 25. Based upon the approach path of the glider; I told the student that we were clear to depart. The student self-announced our departure; waited a few seconds and then pulled out onto the runway applying full power for takeoff. I did a quick scan of our plane's instruments and control settings and then turned my attention to the runway ahead of us as the plane accelerated and the student lifted it from the runway. As I scanned ahead; the glider on approach to the grass landing on the South side of runway 25 turned to the North crossing directly in front of our plane as we were passing through approximately 100 feet AGL. The altitude of the glider at this point was approximately 75 feet higher and descending while it appeared to be about 400 feet in front of our plane. I immediately took control from the student. As the glider was descending and our plane was gaining speed and altitude; I did not believe that I could easily hold the plane below the glider nor did I believe that I could effectively climb above the glider. I also felt that a turn to the left (south) would have placed me over other planes and people at the glider operations and brought me back into the path of the glider if he turned back to land. My only option was to bank the plane to the right (North) on the same heading as the glider. I lowered our plane's nose to try to stop my climb and increase my airspeed and entered approximately a 30 to 35 degree banked turn to the North side of runway 25. My turn brought me approximately 250 to 300 feet off the North side of runway 25 before observing the glider made a sharp turn back toward the glider operation area on the South side of the runway. I then leveled out the turn passing approximately 200 feet from the glider at the same altitude. We continued our climb out departing from the airport.It is my belief that the problem arose due to the glider's failure to visually clear the runway for traffic and the glider's performance of a low level maneuver (circle) over and into the potential flight path of other aircraft rather than turning in a direction outside of the runway environment.

There was complex weather that had reports of extreme turbulence where the pilot had lost control of their aircraft briefly in the next sector. The traffic was moderate and starting to back up because of the delays and holding in the sector. In the beginning the sectors were combined. The Controller In Charge (CIC) came over and asked the Supervisor Radar Controller if he wanted to split the sectors and he replied yes. The de-combining of the sectors was not a factor of the incident in my opinion.There were two aircraft holding at an intersection at the time; one at 7000 feet and one at 8000 feet. There was a VFR target that had no code indicating 7500 feet heading on a northwest track for the holding pattern. This same aircraft I had noticed had initially been at 9500 feet. I told the supervisor to 'Watch out for that 095 ...'. This target was in conflict with an arrival leaving 10000 feet for 7000 feet. The supervisor turned the arrival to the east and it was not a factor. The report of extreme turbulence had been reported by a PC12 from 3000-6000 feet and the weather had now moved becoming a problem for the Arrival aircraft. All of the arrivals required 2-3 point outs and I suggested to the supervisor to hold the aircraft north of the weather so it would create less safety hazards; work and no one would go anywhere near the extreme turbulence that was moving in. He did not take my suggestion and I kept doing the point outs and coordination. Poor judgment was used in this situation.After getting off the line with one Center sector on a point out I noticed the 7500 foot target 5 miles from the 7000 foot IFR traffic in holding. I asked my supervisor 'did you call that traffic'; the supervisor responded 'no; I didn't see it'. The aircraft holding then turned into the VFR aircraft because he was starting his turn in the hold. The supervisor issued a Traffic Alert and the targets merged; but the VFR target had climbed up to 7900 feet. After the target (not in communications with Air Traffic) passed the IFR aircraft in our sector the target started descending below 6500 feet but was no longer a factor. The 8000 foot IFR aircraft that was originally in holding had been cleared out of holding and handed off to the next sector. During this same session a MSV departure departed. The supervisor instructed me not to take the handoff because 'We shouldn't be working these guys.' Center sector that was working the airplane had to call for a handoff and the supervisor was reluctant to take it even though there was no traffic or complexity with the aircraft in this situation. He finally took radar contact on the aircraft and climbed him to 17000 feet. This contributed to the complexity of the Assist-side duties because now a point out to Approach was required and a call on a handoff to a Center. During this time I was also calling other Center sectors for point outs. I do not recall if this was after or before the situation with the Traffic Alert.The workload was too great for the supervisor to be working and his judgment was poor creating safety hazards; a safety event (Traffic Alert); and increased workload. The first recommendation would be to not allow supervisors to work busy traffic. Controlling airplanes is not their primary job and they should work light traffic ('Green'). If staffing is an issue there should be more Traffic Management initiatives instead of a supervisor working busy traffic.The second recommendation is to have the MSV departures worked by Center again. If they were flight planned on a different route it would take off a few miles on their route and additional Center sectors would not have to work the aircraft. The reason it is complicated for Center is because their sector has minimal time to climb the aircraft; possibly do a point out to Approach and call on a handoff since the aircraft handoff is initiated after the 'two minutes from theboundary' rule. It is also complex because the Center Sector gets aircraft from Approach; an adjacent center; and EWR Satellite traffic all in the area of MSV.",,,,"ZBW Center Controller observed that the traffic complexity was too much for a Supervisor that was working the radar position for proficiency time. Also the Controller recommended a new procedure for departures from MSV.",

Aircraft Y was on a southwest bound route. I initially climbed Aircraft Y  to 15000 feet and issued traffic to both aircraft. Aircraft Y reported Aircraft X in sight and since they were the only two aircraft in the vicinity and it appeared Aircraft Y would be crossing behind the path of Aircraft X. I instructed Aircraft Y to maintain visual separation and climb to 23000 feet. I did not clearly understand Aircraft Y 's read back the first time so I restated and asked for clarification that he would maintain visual separation. He responded that he would. I then told Aircraft X that the other traffic had him in sight and would be climbing visually behind him. At the point that I made the decision to apply visual separation rules. The speed and climb rate of Aircraft Y led me to think that he would be passing behind Aircraft X and targets would not merge. Aircraft X then reported that he was responding to an Resolution Advisory (RA) and was climbing. I then verified again that Aircraft Y still had the aircraft in sight. Aircraft Y responded that he did and I told him that Aircraft X was responding to an RA and climbing now. Aircraft X then stated his concern for an aircraft getting that close to him and Aircraft Y stated that they weren't that close. I don't think I would leave separation decisions to a general aviation pilot when an airline carrying hundreds of passengers are involved. Although visual separation is a tool to expedite traffic flow in this situation it would have only been a minute delay before the aircraft could continue his climb.",,"We were then handed off to Boston departure and assigned a heading of 230 and a climb up to 14;000 feet; which we did. Boston departure then handed us off to Boston Center. Boston Center then gave us a climb clearance to 15;000 feet. We were later issued another clearance to turn to another heading and a climb to a flight level. My First Officer read back just the heading and not the altitude and the controller never corrected him with the flight level he wanted us to climb to. In the interest of safety; I didn't begin the climb until I was certain of what flight level he wanted us to climb to.He then told us that we had traffic at 10 o'clock and 10 miles south west bound; an Embraer at 16;000 feet and that we should report the traffic which we did. He then advised [the Embraer] that they had traffic at two to 3 o'clock southwest bound; a Lear Jet climbing 1000 feet below them. He then got back to us to confirm that we had the traffic and that we were climbing to FL230. Now certain that we were cleared to FL230; we began our climb and received an RA telling us to descend and then level off.

I noticed the aircraft in a right turn and was called by ZNY N56 stating that they are going to spin Aircraft X because of Aircraft Y. I said roger but did not see the aircraft they were referring to. This was because this aircraft; Aircraft Y was still at 36000 feet landing BOS. This aircraft should have been at 27000 feet. Nothing was coordinated with this descent from N56. What made this scenario dangerous was the N56 controller spun Aircraft X into the rest of their line of BOS arrivals that were at 27000 feet.The conflict alert was going off constantly during this time with no coordination from N56 controller as to what the plan was for this aircraft that I had the handoff on. I was pointing out Aircraft Y to other sectors down the line and N56 ran another aicraft into my airspace at 27000 feet without a handoff. I do not know if point-outs were made to other appropriate sectors from N56 but given their lack of coordination; I would assume other sectors were not coordinated with as well.  This problem seemed like it was a typical issue. Either Aircraft Y went NORDO; controller didn't realize Aircraft Y was landing BOS or Aircraft Y did not start his/her descent. The part that makes this dangerous is the lack of coordination from N56. I have been at ZBW for just under 10 years and it seems like myself and the rest of the controllers here at ZBW have just accepted that ZNY does not like to use landlines and are very hard to get on the landline. This culture is the same with N90. I don't know how to fix this long-standing issue. But this lack of coordination and communication to other controllers as to what N56's plan was for this BOS scenario is what made this scenario reportable and dangerous. I could not help to solve the problem because I could not find out what the controllers plan was. From my end of the scenario; it appears that if the N56 controller spun Aircraft Y who was too high anyway; this would have been a lot less dangerous.",,,,"ZBW Center Controller reported communication issues with ZNY leading to an aircraft entering his sector without coordination.",

I received a few reports of moderate chop from some heavy aircraft near the SYR VOR; so I decided to call Cleveland ARTCC as well as ZNY to let them know that I was receiving very poor riders in that area; and that I'd prefer if they started sending me aircraft below FL310 to avoid the bad rides. I called ZNY and in the process of trying to inform the controller of the rides; he abruptly interrupted me and informed me that he was 'getting moderate everywhere'; and had a holding stack of 7 or 8 aircraft. It sounded like the controller was quite busy; so I tried to quickly convey that I wanted the aircraft from him delivered to me below FL310. Around this time; I took a handoff on a EWR arrival on the western half of my sector. I issued the aircraft to cross HNK VOR at FL180; per the normal crossing restriction. A few minutes later; an aircraft checked onto my frequency at FL210. I had no idea who the aircraft was; and at the same time; I received a phone call from ZNY trying to reach me on the shout line.During all of this; I was quite busy; due to trying to convey the ride conditions to several aircraft; and if I recall correctly I was also sequencing several aircraft for CYUL. I picked up the land line as soon as I was able; and ZNY informed me that he shipped me the aircraft accidentally; to which I responded I'll take radar and sort it out. The problem that I identified was that the aircraft was in direct confliction with my EWR arrival; especially since the ZNY controller had erroneously left the aircraft on a heading. I immediately amended the altitude of my EWR arrival; and resolved the situation. I feel if I had been busier; or not as vigilant in my identification of the confliction that it could have led to an operational error.The ZNY controller seemed quite busy so I might suggest if he was working several combined sectors that he either be provided a d-side; or another controller to help him out by taking some of his sectors. I was also quite busy at the time and I feel perhaps it would be better to have 3 controllers on the midnight shift instead of just 2. With only 2 controllers on ZBW's mid shifts; we are essentially forced to divide the shift into two 3+ hour shifts; which is extremely fatiguing especially when issues are compounded by bad rides; deviations; or simply unusual situations (that happen with regularity as any CPC knows).",,,,"ZBW Center Controller reported another Controller mistakenly transferred him an aircraft that was in conflict with his traffic.",

FO was flying. I told the FO at all 3 times that he would continue flying the plane (since the first change we were descending via the arrival and I wanted him to pay attention to the VNAV and all speed restrictions). As we passed PROVI; we were given a left turn. The controller gave us a runway change to 4R from 22L. I again told the FO; I would do the all the FMS changes and would brief the ILS. When we switched to the final controller; he gave us 4L visual approach. I again did the FMS changes. The FO told me that he had never done the visual approach to 4L. I explained to him that there was an FMS RNAV but we did not have that approach on the EFB; however; we could use it as a backup to the visual approach. I also told him [not] to worry that I would walk him through it.During all these changes; we were told to look for traffic to follow. I was dividing my attention between being heads down reprogramming the FMS and looking outside at night for traffic to follow (which was the plane that would be parallel to us on a visual to RWY 4R). ATC told us to slow to 190 knots and a descent to 4;000 feet. Once we had the traffic in-sight; the controller gave us the visual approach; a turn towards the airport; told us to maintain 170 knots to 5 mile final; cross the 10 DME at or above 3;000 feet; and to contact tower at 128.8. I was trying to make all the appropriate FMS changes for intercept the course; keep the airplane on 4R in-sight; make all the configuration changes that the FO was calling for (gear; flaps; speed and altitude on the guidance panel and to draw a 10 mile ring on the moving map to identify the 10 DME/3000 feet restriction).The frequency was extremely busy since we had been with BOS Center since they were giving everyone basically S-turns because of the runway changes and with approach as they were getting saturated funneling everyone with the runway changes. As we were on the final phase of intercepting the 10 mile ring; the final controller told us that he needed us going directly to the runway. I told him that we were and that we were turning through a heading of 070 already. As we started the final descent; I told the FO to disconnect the autopilot and to hand flying it and to use the VNAV glide path as reference and that I would give him a 3 degree descent angle to cross-reference his descent.When the autopilot disconnected; we received a very loud 'autopilot' continuous disconnect aural warning. As I have been a CA/FO on this model of aircraft for many years; I knew that the continuous aural warning is related to the trim system when the autopilot is flying. We both again pressed our respective autopilot discount buttons to try to silence the warning; but it did not stop. At the same time; we received a TCAS RA with the traffic off to our right. I believe the TCAS detected that we were both descending; with a closure rate but it cannot distinguished that we were on a very closed parallel approach. I told the FO 'My aircraft' and simply called for a go around. I manually overrode the autopilot. I called for flaps 2 and gear up as I initiated a climb. The tower noticed that we were going around and called us. I simply clicked the mike and said; 'standby'. I prioritized flying with newer FO; letting catch up with what was going on as we still trying to speak to each other on a busy frequency; with a continuous loud aural warning and reconfiguring the aircraft. A few seconds later; the tower told us to turn to the left; that if able to maintain 3;000 feet and to let him know if we needed any assistance. We complied with his instructions and told him that we had an autopilot issue and we needed to run a checklist.I called for the FO to run the QRH procedure for the autopilot aural warning. The FO successfully ran the QRH and the aural message stopped. I transfer control of the aircraft back to the FO and we were vectored back around for a normal landing. I should have turned down the visual approach for a number of reasons. A very late third change of runway; flying with not a very experienced FO; at night; how close we were to the airport and the complexity of reprogramming the FMS and doing a so-close parallel approach. I have done this approach a number of times in the daytime; but cannot recall the last time I had to do it at night. ATC was trying to keep us parallel to the traffic as we both descended. I think the TCAS sense the closure rate and that was the reason for the RA.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported he received a TCAS RA while on a night visual parallel approach to Runway 4L at BOS; performed a go-around; and eventually was vectored around for a normal landing.",

Traffic was fairly routine with the exception of weather re-routes and in-trail restrictions with no back-to-back BWI or DCA aircraft. Aircraft X from had filed J75. Their preferential route was via J48 which had no in-trail restriction. This aircraft sat on the ground on a bad route for 35 minutes and nobody fixed it. If it had been routed via BAF; as it should have been; this never would have happened because they would have been 20 miles north of NELIE over BAF VOR. As I was relieving the 46 controller he mentioned the bad route coming our way. R47 issued the reroute while he was climbing out in their airspace. Because the aircraft was headed towards NELIE; they issued direct TRIBS intersection which put Aircraft X right over NELIE. I took the handoff; climbed the aircraft to FL260 and handed them right to R20; as they were within 10 miles of the border.Subsequently; I took a handoff on Aircraft Y. Typically I would have issued this aircraft direct to CMK; which would have placed him about 10 NM south of NELIE. However; there was a corporate jet at FL400 doing Mach .74 about 30 miles ahead. As I had to provide 20 miles in trail on J75 regardless of type; altitude; or destination; I left Aircraft Y on the route. Aircraft X left my airspace so I suppressed the data block. I climbed Aircraft Y to FL380. Then I took handoffs on 6 BWI arrivals. The flow restriction stated no back-to-back BWI arrivals. I asked my supervisor to talk to Traffic Management Unit (TMU) and ask for guidance on what I should do with these aircraft. I attempted to call ZNY N42 to ask the controller directly for relief. Most of this was taking place in the vicinity of BOS or PVD and that is where my attention was focused. Aircraft Y was approaching the border with R20 and they had yet to accept the handoff. I assumed it was because they were busy trying to blend their flows for ZNY. My supervisor told the R47 controller and myself that we could selectively reroute BWI aircraft down the coast through ZDC. While we were working on this the conflict alert went off with Aircraft Y and Aircraft X. Aircraft Y was climbing through FL241 and Aircraft X was approaching FL250. I vectored Aircraft Y away from Aircraft X and told him to stop his climb and when able return to FL240. The closest proximity that I saw was about 4.5 miles when I got a report from Aircraft Y indicating 1000 feet vertical separation existed.R20 took the handoff. I called them and told them that Aircraft Y was turning back on course; and sarcastically thanked them for calling me about the impending loss of separation. TMU should never had agreed to '20 miles in trail via J75 with no back-to-back BWI or DCA arrivals.' That's a ridiculous restriction. If ZNY needed 40 or 30 miles in trail on BWI and/or DCA aircraft that should have been the restriction. We rerouted 3 airborne aircraft for no real reason. ZNY would have gotten an airplane every 20 miles and who cares what the destination was? This was regardless of altitude.When ZNY decides to take the night off on the backs of ZBW and ZDC they should be called on their bad actions. At a minimum; the J75 in trail should be stratified so that aircraft going further at higher altitude would be separate from aircraft that need to be started down sooner. Pilots need to do a better job of filing the preferential route. A lot of them have the attitude that they will just file whatever and it's our job to fix it. While it is our job; it is their job to file the preferential routes.Our radar Assists need to do a better job fixing bad routes in a timely manner while aircraft are on the ground. The common attitude is 'its close enough; what's the worst that can happen?' Well; a deal can happen. And now the FAA Handbook 7110.65 is changing and we will have to fix routes 30 minutes prior instead of 15. This problem will only get worse. Traffic management Unit was not even monitoring the BWI traffic while there was an in-trail restriction. Need I say more? Despite all of this; I should have told Aircraft Y to expedite through FL270 feet. We are spoiled with the new modern aircraft. Usually a B737 off PVD would cross NELIE above FL300 feet. I'm guessing that because he received a ground delay; Aircraft Y was trading climb rate for forward speed. I should have known better and been proactive.Typically if I hand a slow aircraft to another sector; I watch them for a while beyond my airspace so I don't run them over.

We were then told to expect a visual to 04L and given a vector to be followed by a clearance direct to Boston. We were then asked to report the airport AND traffic off to our right. There were several targets and we informed ATC that we were unable to determine which aircraft they wanted us to report. We were then issued a clearance to turn right to 090 degrees. When I initiated the turn it became very apparent which aircraft they wanted us to see because there was a [large transport aircraft] right in front of us on approach to 04R. I immediately turned the autopilot off and corrected left to avoid a collision with the jet (Aircraft Y). We received a TCAS TA at about the same time I clicked the autopilot off. That approach contained the most mishandled and dangerous clearances I have ever experienced in my entire aviation career.I called the TRACON supervisor to find out why this event occurred. He informed me that there was a trainee controller on both 04L AND 04R and they had issued us a 190 speed in error which put us out in front of Aircraft Y; which is why we didn't see him. He then issued us a 170 speed so Aircraft Y would overtake us. The problem was Aircraft Y had not overtaken us completely when he issued the heading of 090. I then asked why we were not staggered like SFO does. The supervisor informed me they do not stagger in BOS and try and put us wingtip to wingtip. That does not seem like the safest course of action to me. Do not have trainees working two parallel runways at the same time. In addition do not change runway clearances at the last minute. I would also suggest that with close together runways such as 04L and 04R in BOS that we are staggered so as never to be wingtip to wingtip in case someone overshoots the turn or maybe doesn't see the aircraft ATC wants you to see because they are behind you.",,,,"A321 Captain reported a side by side approach with another large turbojet to Runways 4L and 4R that he believed was not safe but was reported as standard practice at BOS.",

The Final Approach controller issued us maintain 170 kts to RIPIT (FAF) during the approach we received Red X's 3 times which would indicate the Localizer isn't working on our instruments. This happened outside the FAF and we were visual and could maintain a visual with the airport that we decided that we wouldn't go around because it was VMC. We continued the Approach. Final asked what speed we were doing. I replied 170 kts. He then came back and said spacing wouldn't work and even if we slowed it wouldn't work. Cancel Approach clearance turn right 360 and maintain 2000 and that he would sequence us back. My Captain then replied over the radio 'Unable we were given red x's and we are having navigational problems.' After a few seconds the Captain then said 'we broke out we need to continue the approach' (we were already visual). Final says traffic to look out for 11 o'clock 800 ft. Captain replies traffic insight. Final says maintain a visual with the traffic cleared ILS 27. I then repeat back maintain visual and clear for the approach. Final asks if we were having issues with navigation. I reply we are visual with the airport. Final hands us off to tower. This whole exchange lasted for over 30 seconds from when he asked how fast we were going until we got the hand off to tower. We were 3.6 DME from the ILS when the other aircraft landed. The red X's appeared around 13.5 to 11.5 DME. Upon taxiing in ground had a number for the captain to call.

We were number one for the field but another aircraft needed to takeoff and a C182 was in the pattern for 19. We were landing 15. While on final the ATC controller instructed the C182 to make right traffic. They informed us they would be at 1300 over the [15] numbers. The C182 was actually on about 3/4 mile west and at 1300 but descending. We were on final for 15 and on glide path. We came within 350 feet or less of the C182. This caused us to be in a no go around situation as we had no maneuvering speed or room once we spotted the airplane and got the TA Traffic call. The only reason we didn't get an RA was because we were too low to the ground on the glideslope. We informed tower that was unacceptable as well as requested the tower supervisor's phone number. We debriefed with him once we landed back to base and explained the situation. He informed us they were operating within their allowances even though it's probably not a good choice. ATC aligning the aircraft incorrectly sequenced for the runways. The C182 being too wide and into our protected final. Loss of Situational awareness on both ATC and C182. If we would have had an out we would have taken it however after spotting the airplane visually we realized we were in a bad spot. A go around would have caused more harm than good and would have most likely caused a midair collision. Have ATC space aircraft better out for that runway so as not to attempt low flybys on landing aircraft for runway 15. Instruct the C182 about what over the numbers means. The BTV pattern procedures need to be reviewed and either have the airplane on the downwind go outside of ours or ATC sequence the two so as not to meet at the same time. Also by having us slow early this probably also contributed to the two aircraft meeting so closely.",,,,"ERJ Captain reported a NMAC with a C182 on final for Runway 15 at BTV.",

There were a flight of military fighters southbound at FL240B250. I had a JFK arrival Aircraft Z (don't remember the call sign I'll call it Aircraft Z) who was at FL220. The sector above me who was working Aircraft X had some traffic he was trying to separate and in order to help I descended Aircraft Z to 140 to give him a lower altitude on Aircraft X if he needed it. Aircraft Z was still in sector 18s airspace and I did not have time to call and get control. As the situation seamed to resolve itself; a minute later we saw that Aircraft X was in conflict alert with Aircraft Y (not sure on the call-sign) and Aircraft Y's altitude was showing FL230B240 in sector 18s airspace with Aircraft X just clipping 18s airspace going northbound. Both myself and the sector working Aircraft X missed that the flight plan on the high altitude map showed the missing sector 18s airspace; but on the low altitude map which they didn't display shows Aircraft X's route of flight just nearly hitting sector 18's airspace. It was in this airspace that sector 18 who didn't get a point out from Aircraft X and didn't see a data block; descended Aircraft Y from FL240B250 to FL230B240. This route that Aircraft X was on was a reroute for VIP airspace. This route which will keep clear of 1 traffic flow is a new route to us and not what we are used to seeing.

This made sense as the prevailing winds were reported at 080 degrees and 7 knots. A few aircraft were heading towards the airport and I communicated with at least two of the three known aircraft flying in the vicinity. While on a 3 mile final approach to Runway 10; I announced my position on the CTAF that I had the landing traffic ahead of me in sight and that I was following it in. When I was approximately 2 miles from the runway; I again announced my position and that I had a visual of the plane in front of me touching down. By this point my airplane was on 'short approach' to Runway 10. No other aircraft announced they were on final approach. As I approached 1 mile from the threshold of Runway 10; approximately 500 ft AGL; I noticed another airplane swoop in at my 9 o'clock position (from my left) and overtake my airplane and swoop in lower than me to beat me to the runway. Horrified; I broke off from final approach and called a 'go-around' and climbed out to pattern altitude of 1;107 ft MSL. I commented on the CTAF to the pilot of the other aircraft; who was not immediately identified; that he had performed an unsafe maneuver. The other pilot barked back; 'I was ahead of you!' Clearly; he was not. In fact; the other pilot appears to have broken subsection g of 'Right of Way' Rule 91.113: '(g) Landing. Aircraft; while on final approach to land or while landing; have the right-of-way over other aircraft in flight or operating on the surface; except that they shall not take advantage of this rule to force an aircraft off the runway surface which has already landed and is attempting to make way for an aircraft on final approach. When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of landing; the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way; but it shall not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another which is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft.'After I re-joined the pattern and safely landed on Runway 10 about 10 minutes later; I was led by an airport marshal to park my airplane next to the one that had cut me off. The pilot and any person(s) who had been on the aircraft had departed the area.I would like to see the ALB FSDO investigate the pilot who nearly caused a mid-air collision with my airplane. He not only caused alarm to myself; but he horrified my 10-year-old nephew on his first single engine flight over water. I am grateful for my good aeronautical training to take evasive action to voluntarily break-off; climb; and go-around. The pilot of the [other aircraft] appeared; at the very least oblivious to my presence and radio transmissions; but I believe to be reckless in his actions to speed up; since; he has a faster aircraft; and dive dangerously below my altitude to race me to the runway. This could have ended disastrously.",,,,"GA pilot reported being cutoff on final at BID by another GA aircraft that necessitated a go-around.",
